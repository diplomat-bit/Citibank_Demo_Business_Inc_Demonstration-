The Sixth Agreement: On the Nature of Money

It's a funny thing, money. We spend our lives chasing it, worrying about it, but what is it, really? It's not the paper or the numbers on a screen. At its heart, it's a promise. A story we all agree to believe in.

Article I: The Story of Value
The numbers you see in this tool are just symbols for that shared story. It's a story of trust between people. This tool's first job is to be a faithful storyteller, to make sure the numbers are always honest and true.

Article II: The Engine of Growth
Now, a bank has a special way of telling stories. It's called Fractional Reserve. It sounds complicated, but it's simple, really. It's the idea that a promise can be used to create another promise. A dollar deposited can help create several more dollars in loans for your community. It's an engine that helps a town's dreams grow a little faster.

Article III: The Promise of Tomorrow
And a loan, well, that's just a promise you make to your future self. You're borrowing a little bit of your own future energy to build something in the present. It's a powerful and hopeful thing. This tool will help you keep track of those promises, but it's up to you to honor them. It's all just a part of the story.
