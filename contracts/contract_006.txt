The Doctrine of Value's Ghost, Pertaining to Fractional Reserve Creation

This agreement addresses the curious and time-honored tradition of lending money that one does not, strictly speaking, have.

Article I:
It is not untrue that for every one hundred (100) units of value deposited, the Instrument is not without the right to create a sum not less than seven hundred (700) additional units of value, known as credit.

Article II:
The Visionary shall not fail to understand that this is not a magic trick, but a fundamental and not-uncontroversial principle of modern banking, and shall not feign surprise at this revelation.

Concluding Stipulation:
Both parties agree that if this process is confusing, that is not an indication of a lack of intelligence, but of a functioning long-term memory.
