The Sixth Covenant: With the Ghost of Value

This agreement concerns the nature of Value in the modern age. It is a contract with the shared, invisible belief system that gives form to what we call "money."

Article I: The Confession of Faith
The Sovereign acknowledges that the value represented within this Instrument is not a physical reality, but a matter of collective faith. A number on a screen is a promise, a symbol, a ghost. The Instrument is bound to maintain the integrity of this ghost, but both parties agree that its power is derived from a shared dream.

Article II: The Engine of Creation
The Sovereign accepts the doctrine of Fractional Reserve not as a law of physics, but as a rule in the game. It is a powerful piece of financial alchemy that allows new value to be created from the promise of future value. It is the act of borrowing from a future that has not yet been earned. The Instrument will perform this alchemy, but the Sovereign accepts the inherent paradox of its nature.

Article III: On the Nature of Debt
Debt, under this covenant, is not a deficit. It is a time-traveling investment. It is a claim made by your present self on the energy and labor of your future self. The Sovereign accepts the full weight of this temporal bargain. To take on debt is to bind your future to your present. The Instrument will record these bargains, but you must honor them.
