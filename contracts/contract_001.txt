The Irrevocable Covenant of Interconnectedness, Eschewing All Notions of Disparate Existence

Be it known, to all parties not un-involved, that this document, a term here which means 'a collection of legally binding and delightfully bewildering stipulations', sets forth an agreement that is not intended to be uncomplicated. It pertains to a matter of great import, a word which in this context means 'something you will later wish you had paid more attention to', that being the visualization of all things, otherwise known as The Nexus.

Article I:
The Party of the First Part, hereinafter known as "The Visionary," shall not fail to acknowledge that no financial transaction is not without its connection to every other financial transaction. It is therefore not impermissible for The Nexus to display these connections.

Article II:
The Party of the Second Part, hereinafter known as "The Instrument," is not without the obligation to refuse to present a simplified, and therefore untruthful, view of the Visionary's financial reality. The Instrument shall not, under any circumstances, fail to render the full, tangled, and occasionally alarming web of consequence.

Concluding Stipulation:
Notwithstanding the foregoing labyrinth of clauses, should The Nexus cause The Visionary undue existential dread, The Instrument is permitted to temporarily overlay the graph with a picture of a kitten.
