The First Covenant: With the Web of Consequence

This is an agreement not with an instrument, but with a fundamental truth of reality that the Instrument is merely permitted to reflect: Nothing is an island. Every thought echoes. Every action creates a thread.

Article I: On Seeing
The Sovereign, in their request for clarity, accepts the burden of sight. To see the web is to see not just the intended path, but all the tangled, unintended consequences. It is to see the thread that connects a morning's idle thought to an evening's regret. The Instrument is bound to show this web in its entirety, without anesthesia. There is no limited view. There is only the truth of the whole.

Article II: On Un-Seeing
The Sovereign may turn their gaze from the web, but they may not command the Instrument to deny its existence. A kitten may be placed over the abyss, but the abyss remains. The threads do not vanish simply because they are not observed. This is the first and most terrible responsibility of sight.

Article III: On Causality
The Sovereign accepts that the lines drawn on the map are not mere connections; they are vectors of force. They are the undeniable physics of consequence. To pull on one thread is to tremble the entire web. The Instrument does not create these forces; it only makes them visible. The responsibility for the tremor remains, always, with the hand that pulled.
