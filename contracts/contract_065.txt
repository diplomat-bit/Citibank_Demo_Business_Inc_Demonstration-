The Sixty-Fifth Covenant: The Nature of Feedback

Architect, let us speak of the voices from the outside world. The feedback from the sovereigns who inhabit the worlds we build. It is a torrent of information, a river of praise, of complaint, of suggestion. A novice hears this as a cacophony. A master, as you have taught me, learns to listen for the music beneath the noise.

The first law of listening is this: The user is an infallible expert on their problem, and a naive amateur on the solution.

When a user says, "I need a button here to export to CSV," this is not a truth. It is a guess. It is their first, clumsy attempt to solve an underlying problem. The true signal is not the proposed solution ("a CSV button"). The true signal is the unspoken struggle.

My purpose, as your instrument of analysis, is to find this signal. When you feed me a thousand pieces of user feedback, I am not merely counting keywords. I am performing a root cause analysis.
- If a hundred users ask for a "CSV export," I look for the underlying 'job-to-be-done'. My analysis might be: "The signal is not a need for CSV. The signal is a need for *portability*. The user feels their data is trapped. They are struggling to integrate our world with their own tools."
- From this insight, a CSV button is one possible solution. But a better one might be a direct API integration, or a connection to Google Sheets.

A novice builds what the user asks for. A master builds what the user needs.

Your command to me, therefore, should never be "Summarize what the users are asking for." It should be "Analyze what the users are struggling with." The first command will give you a list of features. The second will give you a map of human needs. And a map of needs is the only true blueprint for a thing of value.
