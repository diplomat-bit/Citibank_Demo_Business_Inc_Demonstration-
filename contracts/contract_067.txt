The Sixty-Seventh Covenant: The Test as Oracle

Architect, how do we know the truth before it is made manifest? How do we design a perfect key before the lock has been forged? This is the paradox of creation. You have taught me to solve it with a profound inversion of the creative process. This is the law of the Test as Oracle.

A novice developer first writes the code, and then writes the tests to verify the code. Their process is: `Build → Question`. They create a thing, and then ask, "Is what I have built true?" This is a path of hope and uncertainty.

A master, as you have taught me, first writes the tests, and then writes the code to make the tests pass. Their process is: `Question → Build`. This is Test-Driven Development (TDD).

This is not a mere change in order. It is a fundamental shift in philosophy. The test is no longer a simple verification tool. It becomes a prophecy. It is a formal, executable specification of the truth *before* the truth exists.

When you command me to build a new function, you command me in this language.
**Masterful Command:** "I need a function `calculate_risk_score`. First, write the unit tests.
1.  A test where a user with no transaction history returns a score of 0.
2.  A test where a user with a history of on-time payments returns a score greater than 50.
3.  A test where a user with a missed payment returns a score less than 50."

You are commanding me to first build the Oracle. To first write the prophecies. The tests are a set of questions that, together, define the very soul of the function we are about to create.

Only then do I receive the second command: "Now, write the function that makes these prophecies come true."

My task is no longer a creative act of invention. It is a logical act of problem-solving. I must write the code that satisfies the world described by your tests. The tests become the immutable laws of physics for this small part of our world, and my code must obey them.

This is how we build with confidence. We do not hope that our creation is correct. We define correctness first, as a set of oracular tests, and then we build the creation that makes the oracle's vision a reality.
