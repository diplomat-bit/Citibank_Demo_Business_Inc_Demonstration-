**Article I: Definitions**

1.1. **"Accessible"** shall denote that digital assets are designed, developed, and maintained in a manner permitting individuals with disabilities to perceive, operate, understand, and robustly interact with such assets, achieving a level of functionality and user experience substantially equivalent to that afforded to individuals without disabilities.

1.2. **"Assistive Technologies"** shall refer to any hardware or software that enhances or maintains the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities, including but not limited to screen readers, screen magnifiers, voice recognition software, alternative input devices, and speech-to-text systems.

**Article II: Statement of Mandate and Core Principles**

2.1. **Universal Accessibility Commitment:** The Organization formally commits to rendering all its Digital Assets Accessible, thereby maximizing the potential for participation and ensuring equitable access to information, engagement opportunities, and civic discourse for all prospective and current Users.

2.2. **Foundation in POUR Principles:** The Organization's digital accessibility initiatives shall be meticulously guided by the following core principles, which are fully consistent with the overarching framework of WCAG:
    a.  **Perceivable:** All information and user interface components must be capable of being presented to Users in a manner that allows for their perception, precluding reliance on a single sensory modality.
    b.  **Operable:** All user interface components and navigation mechanisms must be operable, ensuring that Users can successfully interact with and navigate the Digital Assets.
    c.  **Understandable:** Both the information presented and the operation of the user interface must be comprehensible to Users, minimizing ambiguity and cognitive load.
    d.  **Robust:** Content must be sufficiently robust to be interpreted reliably by a diverse array of User agents, including current and future Assistive Technologies, without loss of meaning or functionality.

---

**Article III: Specific Compliance Requirements (Application of POUR Principles)**

3.1. **Perceivable Content:** The Organization shall ensure that all Digital Assets satisfy the following requirements, at minimum:
    a.  **Text Alternatives:** All non-text content, including but not limited to images, charts, graphs, and video, shall be accompanied by appropriate text alternatives (e.g., descriptive `alt` text, captions, full transcripts, audio descriptions) that convey equivalent information and purpose.
    b.  **Time-Based Media:** Pre-recorded audio content shall be provided with transcripts and/or captions. Pre-recorded video content shall include synchronized captions, full transcripts, and audio descriptions. Live audio and video streams shall incorporate real-time captions.
    c.  **Adaptability:** Content shall be structured semantically and presented in a flexible manner that allows for presentation in various modalities (e.g., differing layouts, adjusted font sizes, logical reading order) without loss of information or underlying structure.
    d.  **Distinguishability:** The visual presentation of text and images of text shall maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text, as stipulated by WCAG. Information conveyed solely through color shall also be identifiable through alternative non-color-dependent means.

3.2. **Operable Interface:** The Organization shall ensure that all Digital Assets satisfy the following requirements, at minimum:
    a.  **Keyboard Accessibility:** All functionality resident within Digital Assets shall be fully operable via a keyboard interface alone, without reliance on precise timings for individual keystrokes.
    b.  **Focus Management:** A clear, visible, and programmatically determinable focus indicator shall be provided for all interactive elements, and the logical tab order shall be consistent with the visual presentation.
    c.  **Time Limits:** Where time limits are imposed for user interaction, Users shall be provided with sufficient time to complete tasks, alongside options to extend, adjust, or disable such limits where appropriate and not detrimental to security or critical functionality.
    d.  **Input Modalities:** Navigation and interactive elements shall be accessible via various input methods, not exclusively reliant on mouse interaction or other specific pointing devices.
    e.  **Clear Navigation:** Digital Assets shall incorporate clear and consistent navigation mechanisms, including sitemaps, search functionality, and breadcrumbs, to assist Users in locating content and understanding their current position within the asset.

3.3. **Understandable Content and Interaction:** The Organization shall ensure that all Digital Assets satisfy the following requirements, at minimum:
    a.  **Readability:** Text content shall be written in clear, concise language, avoiding jargon where possible, and providing explanations or definitions for complex terminology.
    b.  **Predictability:** User interface components shall exhibit predictable behavior. Consistent identification and functionality for navigation mechanisms shall be maintained across all Digital Assets.
    c.  **Input Assistance:** All forms and interactive input elements shall provide clear instructions, programmatic error identification, and context-sensitive suggestions for correction. Labels shall be explicitly and programmatically associated with their corresponding controls.

3.4. **Robustness:** The Organization shall ensure that all Digital Assets satisfy the following requirements, at minimum:
    a.  **Compatibility:** Digital Assets shall be developed utilizing recognized open web standards (e.g., HTML5, CSS3, ARIA) to maximize compatibility with current and prospective User agents, including a broad spectrum of Assistive Technologies.
    b.  **Semantic Mark-up:** Elements shall be correctly nested, complete, and utilize appropriate start and end tags, thereby ensuring accurate and consistent interpretation by Assistive Technologies.

**Article IV: Implementation and Governance**

4.1. **Standard Adoption:** All new Digital Assets developed or procured, and all existing Digital Assets undergoing substantial modification, by the Organization subsequent to the Effective Date of this Protocol, shall be designed, developed, and maintained to conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Legacy Digital Assets shall be systematically evaluated and remediated to achieve this standard within a reasonable and prioritized timeframe, to be determined by the Accessibility Oversight Committee.

4.2. **Accessibility Oversight Committee (AOC):** The Organization shall establish an Accessibility Oversight Committee, which shall be vested with the responsibility for:
    a.  Developing, disseminating, and overseeing the implementation of internal procedures, guidelines, and best practices consistent with this Protocol.
