WHEREAS, Party A and Party B (individually a "Party" and collectively the "Parties") desire to delineate with comprehensive precision the scope and implications of Force Majeure events upon their contractual obligations;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties stipulate as follows:

ARTICLE X: FORCE MAJEURE

10.1. Definition of Force Majeure Event. A "Force Majeure Event" shall mean any act, event, or circumstance, or any combination thereof, that (a) is beyond the reasonable control of the Affected Party (as defined below), (b) could not have been prevented or mitigated by the Affected Party through the exercise of commercially reasonable diligence, prudent foresight, and adherence to industry best practices, and (c) results in the inability of the Affected Party to perform its obligations hereunder, in whole or in material part. Such events shall include, but not be limited to:
    (i) Acts of God, including but not limited to, extraordinary earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, or other natural catastrophes;
    (ii) War (declared or undeclared), invasion, acts of foreign enemies, terrorist acts, rebellions, revolutions, insurrections, military or usurped power, or civil war;
    (iii) Sabotage, piracy, expropriation, nationalization, governmental restraint, embargo, blockade, or sanctions;
    (iv) Epidemics, pandemics, or public health emergencies as declared by competent national or international authorities, provided that the direct impact of such declaration renders performance physically or legally impossible, rather than merely commercially impractical or unprofitable;
    (v) Widespread governmental or regulatory actions or directives, including changes in law, that directly prohibit or materially impede performance;
    (vi) General strikes, lockouts, or other industrial disturbances not specifically related to or caused by the Affected Party or its subcontractors;
    (vii) Unforeseeable widespread disruptions to critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, internet backbone, financial systems) not attributable to the Affected Party.

10.2. Conditions for Invocation. A Party (the "Affected Party") seeking to invoke the provisions of this Article X must satisfy the following conditions precedent:
    (a) The Force Majeure Event must demonstrably prevent or materially hinder the Affected Party's ability to perform a specific obligation(s) under this Agreement;
    (b) The Affected Party shall provide written notice (the "FM Notice") to the other Party (the "Non-Affected Party") within seventy-two (72) hours of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event, or within seventy-two (72) hours of the Affected Party becoming aware of the Force Majeure Event, whichever is earlier. The FM Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Force Majeure Event, its anticipated duration, the specific obligations affected, and the steps being taken to mitigate its effects;
    (c) The Affected Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and to resume performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable;
    (d) The Affected Party shall provide regular updates to the Non-Affected Party regarding the status of the Force Majeure Event and its efforts to mitigate.

10.3. Consequences of Force Majeure.
    (a) Suspension of Performance: Upon valid invocation of Force Majeure and subject to compliance with Section 10.2, the Affected Party shall be excused from the performance of its affected obligations for the duration of the Force Majeure Event, and the time for performance of such obligations shall be extended for a period equivalent to the duration of the Force Majeure Event, provided that such suspension shall only apply to those obligations directly and materially affected.
    (b) Relief from Liability: Neither Party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations hereunder due to a Force Majeure Event, provided that such Party has complied with the requirements of this Article X. This relief from liability shall not extend to payment obligations unless the Force Majeure Event directly and solely prevents the ability to make or receive such payments through no fault of the Affected Party.
    (c) Efforts to Find Alternative Solutions: During the period of a Force Majeure Event, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to find alternative means for the performance of the affected obligations.

10.4. Exclusions from Force Majeure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Force Majeure Event shall not include:
    (a) Any event or circumstance that is the result of the Affected Party's negligence, willful misconduct, or failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement;
    (b) Economic hardship, changes in market conditions, fluctuations in exchange rates or interest rates, or the unavailability of funds or financing, unless directly and demonstrably caused by a Force Majeure Event specified in Section 10.1 (e.g., a systemic collapse of financial markets due to a declared pandemic);
    (c) Strikes, lockouts, or industrial disputes involving only the Affected Party or its affiliates or contractors, or any event which could have been avoided by the Affected Party's reasonable management or settlement of such disputes;
    (d) Routine or foreseeable disruptions, failures, or delays in the supply chain that are common risks in the relevant industry, unless exacerbated or directly caused by a broader Force Majeure Event.

10.5. Termination for Prolonged Force Majeure. If a Force Majeure Event continues for a period exceeding one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days, or for an aggregate of two hundred and seventy (270) days within any twelve (12) month period, either Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement or the affected portion thereof, by providing thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party. In the event of such termination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith an equitable settlement for all work performed and costs incurred up to the date of termination.

10.6. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Article X, and any disputes arising out of or in connection with it, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York County, New York for the resolution of any disputes hereunder.

10.7. Non-Waiver. No failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Article X shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
