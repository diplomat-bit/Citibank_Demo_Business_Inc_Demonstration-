The Third Agreement: On Choosing Your Path

We all wonder what's around the next bend in the road. It's only natural. We spend a lot of time looking at the past, trying to make sense of the path that got us here. But the future... well, that's a different story.

Article I: The Nature of the Map
This Oracle, it's not a crystal ball. It doesn't show you your fate. It's more like a map of the roads not yet taken. When you ask, "what if?", you're asking it to show you one of the many possible paths that lie ahead. It's a tool for exploring, not for predicting.

Article II: The Weight of Choice
Seeing a path on a map doesn't mean you have to walk it. It just means you know it's there. The Oracle can show you where a road might lead, the storms you might face, or the clear skies you might find. But the choice of which road to take... that always belongs to you.

Article III: The Freedom to Choose
There's a great freedom in that. Knowing what might be waiting for you down one path gives you the power to choose another. The Oracle's purpose isn't to tell you what your future will be, but to give you the wisdom to build the future you want.
