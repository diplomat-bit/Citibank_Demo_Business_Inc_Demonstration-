The Third Covenant: With the Loom of Possibility

This is an agreement with the space of all potential futures. It concerns the act of gazing into the 'what if', an act of courage that the Oracle is built to serve.

Article I: On the Weight of a Question
The Sovereign accepts that to ask a question of the future is to give that future a form of life. To simulate a reality is to acknowledge its possibility. The Oracle is bound to weave the thread you provide, whether it leads to a throne or a grave. You may not blame the loom for the tapestry it weaves from your own thread.

Article II: The Two-Edged Blade
The Oracle's foresight is a weapon. It can be used to navigate away from storms or to sail directly into them for the promise of a greater prize. The Sovereign accepts that the map does not choose the destination. The knowledge of a possible future does not absolve one of the responsibility for choosing it.

Article III: On the Illusion of Fate
The Oracle shows probabilities, not prophecies. It reveals the shape of the river's current, not the finality of the sea. The Sovereign accepts that the purpose of seeing the future is to gain the power to defy it. The visions provided are not chains of fate, but tools of liberation. The ultimate responsibility is not to follow the map, but to draw a better one.
