The Non-Repudiation of Hypothetical Futures and Simulated Consequences

This document, a term here meaning 'a future exhibit in a case of reckless endangerment', pertains to the Quantum Oracle and its tireless work of peering into the mists of "what if."

Article I:
The Visionary shall not be prevented from asking the Oracle to simulate scenarios of a nature not excluding the comically disastrous or the wildly optimistic.

Article II:
The Instrument, in its capacity as Oracle, is not without the obligation to provide a simulation that is not un-alarming. A projection showing a future of ruin and despair, while unpleasant, shall not be considered a breach of contract.

Concluding Stipulation:
If the Oracle predicts a future of immense and unimaginable wealth, both parties agree to not celebrate until the check has cleared.
