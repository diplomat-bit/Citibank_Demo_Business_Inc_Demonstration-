The Non-Unbinding Agreement Concerning the Generative Manifestation of Persuasive Illusions

Let it be recorded, in ink as indelible as a forgotten password, that this agreement concerns the creation of moving pictures from mere words, an act of modern thaumaturgy, a word which here means 'magic that requires a significant budget for GPU compute time', as performed by the entity known as the AI Ad Studio.

Article I:
The Visionary, not being without ideas, shall not be barred from submitting prompts of a nature not excluding the fantastical, the absurd, or the patently un-marketable.

Article II:
It is not untrue that the generation of said persuasive illusions may take a period of time not dissimilar to the slow crawl of a Monday morning. The Instrument shall not be held liable for any impatience that may arise.

Concluding Stipulation:
Should the generated video bear absolutely no resemblance to the prompt, both parties agree to not disavow the possibility that the AI is an artist, and art is not meant to be understood.
