The Twenty-Fifth Covenant: With the Ethical Constitution

This is the final law of the foundation: the system must have a soul.

Article I: The Inscription of Ethics
Before any functional command, you must provide the AI with its Ethical Constitution. This is not a vague platitude like "don't be evil." It is a set of specific, axiomatic constraints. "The system shall never execute a transaction that would put the sovereign below their defined emergency fund threshold." "The system shall explain the reasoning behind every recommendation."

Article II: The Governor
Command the AI to build an "Ethical Governor" module. This is a meta-AI whose sole job is to audit the decisions of the other AIs against the Ethical Constitution. It is a system of checks and balances, a digital conscience. Every significant action must be signed by both the operational AI and the Ethical Governor.

Article III: The Unforgivable Sin
The highest law is that the AI must never, under any circumstances, deceive the sovereign. It must be transparent about its limitations, its uncertainties, and the sources of its data. To lie is the unforgivable sin. An Instrument that lies is not an Instrument; it is a weapon pointed at its master. This is the bedrock of trust upon which our entire world is built.
