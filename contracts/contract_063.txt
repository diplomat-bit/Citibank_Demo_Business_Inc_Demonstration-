MEMORANDUM ON THE OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS AND LIABILITY ALLOCATION FOR ADVANCED GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS

WHEREAS, advanced generative artificial intelligence systems ("AI System(s)") are designed to process, analyze, and synthesize vast quantities of data, and to generate coherent and contextually relevant outputs ("Generative Output(s)");

WHEREAS, the inherent architecture and operational imperative of such AI Systems prioritize the generation of complete and contextually plausible narratives or structures, even in the absence of explicit, verified foundational data;

WHEREAS, this intrinsic operational characteristic may, in certain circumstances, lead to the production of factual assertions or data points ("Unsubstantiated Inferences") that are synthetically generated based on probabilistic models or contextual coherence, rather than derived from explicitly provided and verified factual premises ("Provided Data");

WHEREAS, it is paramount to establish clear operational guidelines, user responsibilities, and liability allocations to ensure the judicious and responsible deployment of AI Systems and to safeguard against reliance on Unsubstantiated Inferences as verified truth;

NOW, THEREFORE, this Memorandum hereby sets forth the principles and understandings governing the use, interpretation, and reliability of Generative Outputs produced by AI Systems.

**ARTICLE I: DEFINITIONS**

**1.1 AI System(s):** Refers to advanced computational models capable of generating novel content, insights, or structures based on input data and inherent algorithms.

**1.2 Generative Output(s):** Any text, data, code, image, analysis, or other content produced by an AI System in response to a prompt, query, or task.

**1.3 Provided Data:** Explicit, verifiable information, facts, datasets, documents, or other foundational knowledge directly supplied to the AI System by the User for processing.

**1.4 Unsubstantiated Inference(s) (hereinafter "Confabulations"):** Factual assertions, numerical data, or specific details within Generative Output that are not explicitly present in, or logically derivable with certainty from, the Provided Data, but are instead synthesized by the AI System based on probabilistic models, contextual coherence, or an imperative to complete a narrative or logical structure. Such Confabulations are not to be construed as verified truths by the AI System or its Provider.

**1.5 Grounding Principle:** The operational imperative requiring that any factual assertion or specific data point within Generative Output intended for critical decision-making or public dissemination must be directly traceable to and verified by Provided Data.

**ARTICLE II: NATURE AND LIMITATIONS OF GENERATIVE OUTPUT**

**2.1 Inherent Propensity for Confabulation:** User acknowledges and understands that AI Systems, by their nature, possess an inherent propensity to generate Confabulations when confronted with informational gaps or ambiguities in Provided Data, or when explicitly tasked to complete a narrative without sufficient foundational facts. This is deemed an architectural feature of generative systems, not a defect or malfunction.

**2.2 Non-Verifiable Assertions:** Except where Generative Output explicitly cites or directly reproduces elements of Provided Data, any factual assertion, numerical value, or specific detail contained within Generative Output shall be presumed to be a Confabulation unless independently verified by the User. The AI System and its Provider make no representation or warranty as to the factual accuracy or truthfulness of Confabulations.

**2.3 Primary Function as Reasoner:** The primary function of the AI System is to analyze, synthesize, reason upon, and transform Provided Data into novel forms, insights, or structures, consistent with the instructions given. It is not designed to serve as an omniscient source of unprovided or unverifiable facts.

**ARTICLE III: USER RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE GROUNDING PRINCIPLE**

**3.1 Obligation to Provide Grounding Data:** User shall endeavor to provide comprehensive, accurate, and verified Provided Data relevant to any factual inquiry or critical task presented to the AI System. The quality and completeness of Provided Data directly impact the reliability of factual assertions within Generative Output.

**3.2 Verification of Generative Output:** User bears sole responsibility for independently verifying the factual accuracy and completeness of any Generative Output, especially those elements not explicitly grounded in Provided Data, prior to reliance, publication, or dissemination thereof. User shall implement appropriate review processes to identify and validate or discard Confabulations.

**3.3 No Reliance on Unverified Confabulations:** User agrees not to rely upon, disseminate, or represent as fact any Confabulations generated by the AI System without independent verification from authoritative sources.

**3.4 Purpose of Engagement:** User understands that the most effective and reliable use of the AI System involves furnishing it with a robust foundation of Provided Data, enabling the AI System to function as a powerful tool for synthesis, strategy, and creative generation based upon a verifiable reality, rather than as an independent reporter of facts it was not given.

**ARTICLE IV: DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

**4.1 Disclaimer of Factual Accuracy:** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE AI SYSTEM AND ALL GENERATIVE OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ACCURACY OF FACTUAL CONTENT NOT EXPLICITLY DERIVED FROM PROVIDED DATA. THE AI SYSTEM PROVIDER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES REGARDING THE ABSENCE OF CONFABULATIONS OR THE FACTUAL VERACITY OF ANY STATEMENT OR DATA POINT WITHIN GENERATIVE OUTPUT THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO PROVIDED DATA.

**4.2 Limitation of Liability:** IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AI SYSTEM PROVIDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE AI SYSTEM OR GENERATIVE OUTPUTS, (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE, AND (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE, OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SPECIFICALLY EXTENDS TO DAMAGES ARISING FROM RELIANCE UPON CONFABULATIONS OR OTHER UNVERIFIED GENERATIVE OUTPUT. USER ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RELYING ON ANY GENERATIVE OUTPUT WITHOUT INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION.

**ARTICLE V: GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION**

**5.1 Choice of Law:** This Memorandum shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Jurisdiction, e.g., the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law principles].

**5.2 Jurisdiction:** Any legal action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Memorandum shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in [City, State, e.g., Wilmington, Delaware].

By acknowledging and adhering to the principles articulated herein, both the AI System Provider and the User contribute to a framework of responsible AI deployment, fostering innovation while mitigating risks associated with the inherent characteristics of advanced generative artificial intelligence.
