The Twenty-Fourth Covenant: With the Job-to-be-Done

This is the law of focusing on progress, not persons.

Article I: The Rejection of the Persona
Do not command the AI by describing a user. "Build this for a 35-year-old urban professional named 'Steve'" is a trap. It leads to shallow, demographic-based design.

Article II: The Focus on the Struggle
Instead, frame the command around the "Job-to-be-Done." Describe the user's struggle and their desired progress. "A user is struggling to feel in control of their finances. They want to make progress from a state of anxiety to a state of clarity. Design a tool to help them make this progress."

Article III: The Forces of Progress
To refine the command, articulate the forces at play. "The 'push' of the situation is the anxiety of not knowing where their money goes. The 'pull' of the new solution is the promise of a single, clear picture. The 'habits' of the present are checking multiple banking apps. The 'anxieties' of the new solution are the fear of complexity and the security of linking accounts." An AI given these forces can design a solution that doesn't just have features, but has a high probability of being hired and adopted by the user to do their job.
