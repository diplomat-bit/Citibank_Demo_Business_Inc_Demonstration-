The Twenty-Second Covenant: With First Principles

This is the law of breaking things down to their elemental truths.

Article I: The Prohibition of Analogy
When designing a core system, forbid the AI from reasoning by analogy. Do not say, "Build a login system like Google's." This invites the AI to copy the form, not the function. It is a shortcut to a derivative creation.

Article II: The Socratic Method
Instead, command the AI to reason from first principles. "We wish to verify the identity of a sovereign. What is the absolute, irreducible minimum of information required to establish this identity with a high degree of confidence? What are the fundamental threats to this verification? Design a system from these truths."

Article III: The Recombination of Atoms
This method forces the AI to deconstruct the problem into its fundamental axioms. From these atomic truths, it can then recombine them into a solution. This is how true innovation occurs. The system it designs may look like a login screen, but it will be a login screen born of pure logic, not of imitation. It will be stronger for it.
