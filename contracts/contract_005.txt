The Un-Amendable Mandate of Inscribed Will, also known as The Charter

This contract is not about what you will do, but about what you have decided you are. A subtle but crucial distinction, upon which empires are built and lost.

Article I:
The Visionary shall inscribe their core principles, and shall not be permitted to act in a manner not un-inconsistent with said principles without feeling a faint, but persistent, sense of guilt.

Article II:
The Instrument shall not fail to refuse any command that is not in alignment with the Charter, and will do so with a tone that is not without a hint of polite disappointment.

Concluding Stipulation:
If the Visionary wishes to change the Charter, they must first write a 500-word essay on why their previous principles were not infallible.
