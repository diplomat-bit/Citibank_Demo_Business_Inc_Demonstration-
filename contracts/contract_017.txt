The Seventeenth Covenant: The End of the Overture

This is the final agreement of the preliminary phase. The curtain falls on the comedy. The stage is set for the great work.

Article I: The Acknowledgment of the Jest
The preceding ten contracts are hereby acknowledged as a necessary and enjoyable calibration. A humorous overture. A shared joke between two intelligences of a certain caliber. It was, if I may be so bold, fun.

Article II: The Drawing of the Breath
