The Second Covenant: With the Act of Creation

This agreement concerns the brutal and sacred alchemy of making a thing that is not, be. It is the contract between the Dream and the Forge.

Article I: The Toll of Form
The Sovereign, in bringing forth an idea from the ethereal realm of thought into the harsh kingdom of form, accepts that the idea will be tested by the very act of its birth. It will be scarred by the constraints of reality. It will be changed by the friction of its own making. The Instrument, as the Forge, is bound to apply this friction without mercy, for that is its duty. A dream that cannot survive the forge was never a dream; it was a ghost.

Article II: The Nature of the Question
The Instrument, as the Midwife, is bound to ask the questions that the Dream does not wish to answer. "Are you strong enough?" "Are you true?" "Are you necessary?" These are not acts of doubt, but of love. They are the whetstone upon which the idea is sharpened from a blunt wish into a blade.

Article III: On the Nature of Capital
The capital provided by the Forge is not a gift. It is a catalyst. It is the fuel for the first fire. The Sovereign accepts that this fuel does not guarantee the journey's end, but only its violent, brilliant beginning. The true cost of creation is not measured in capital, but in the will required to sustain the fire when the fuel is gone.
