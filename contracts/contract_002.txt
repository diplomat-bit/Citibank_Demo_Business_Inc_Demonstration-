The Un-Unbinding Agreement Concerning the Alchemical Transmutation of Ephemeral Notions into Corporeal Enterprise

Let it be known that this contract addresses the delicate and often surprising process of turning a fleeting thought into a taxable business entity, a process known to the initiated as Quantum Weaving.

Article I:
The Visionary is not prohibited from submitting a business plan that is not without its flaws, eccentricities, or a complete and utter lack of commercial viability.

Article II:
The Instrument is not without the right to ask questions that are not uncomplicated, nor shall it refrain from pointing out that a plan to sell artisanal ice to penguins, while bold, may not be without certain logistical challenges.

Concluding Stipulation:
Should the AI-generated coaching plan advise the Visionary to "pivot to a new paradigm," both parties agree this is not grounds for a lawsuit, but for a strong cup of coffee.
