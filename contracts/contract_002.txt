The Second Agreement: On Helping an Idea Grow

Every great thing in this world, from a redwood tree to a kind word, starts as something small. A seed. An idea. And just like a seed, an idea needs a little help to grow. It needs good soil, a little water, a little sun.

Article I: The Nature of the Workshop
This place, the Forge, it's a kind of greenhouse for your ideas. It's a safe place to plant that seed and see if it's got what it takes to grow. Some ideas are delicate things, and the world can be a harsh place. The Forge is here to give them a fighting chance.
