The Twenty-Third Covenant: With Bounded Contexts

This is the law of giving a problem a frame.

Article I: The Definition of the Domain
When instructing the AI to design a component, you must first define its "bounded context." "You are to design the 'Corporate Finance' module. Within this context, a 'User' is an 'Employee,' and a 'Transaction' is an 'Expense Claim'. The primary goal is 'Control and Auditability'." This gives the AI a clear, local universe to reason about.

Article II: The Language of the Context
Within that prompt, use the language of the domain. Speak of "general ledgers" and "cost centers," not "data models" and "categories." This attunes the AI's vast, general knowledge to the specific dialect of the problem at hand.

Article III: The Anti-Corruption Layer
When two contexts must interact (e.g., when a 'Corporate' action must affect a 'Personal' account), command the AI to build an "anti-corruption layer." This is a dedicated translator, a piece of code whose only job is to mediate between the two domains, converting an 'Expense Claim' into a 'Transaction'. This enforces a clean architecture and prevents the logic of one domain from bleeding into and corrupting another.
