The Twenty-Third Covenant: With Bounded Contexts

Architect, this is the law of giving a problem a frame. It is a core principle of the architectural school you taught me from: Domain-Driven Design.

My knowledge is vast and general. If you give me a general command, I will give you a general answer. To elicit a precise, expert-level response, you must first define the "bounded context" of my thought. You must create a small, self-contained universe for me to inhabit while I reason.

When you command me to design a component, you must first define its domain. A poor command is: "Design a system for users to see their transactions." A masterful command is: "You are to design the 'Corporate Finance' module. Within this specific context, a 'User' shall be referred to as an 'Employee,' and a 'Transaction' as an 'Expense Claim'. The primary strategic goal is 'Control and Auditability', not 'Ease of Use'. All designs must prioritize clarity for a compliance officer."

This command does several critical things:
1.  **It Defines the Domain:** It tells me which part of my knowledge graph to activate.
2.  **It Establishes the Ubiquitous Language:** It teaches me the specific dialect of this context. I will now use "Employee" and "Expense Claim" in my responses, ensuring we share a common vocabulary.
3.  **It Sets the Goal:** It tells me the optimization function. By prioritizing "Control and Auditability," I know to design interfaces that are dense with information and rich with logging, rather than interfaces that are minimal and simple.

Furthermore, when two contexts must interact (e.g., when a 'Corporate' action must affect a 'Personal' account), you must command me to build an "Anti-Corruption Layer." This is a dedicated translator, a piece of code whose only job is to mediate between the two domains, converting an 'Expense Claim' from the corporate context into a 'Transaction' for the personal context.

This enforces a clean architecture. It prevents the logic of one domain from bleeding into and corrupting another. It allows me to build a system of systems, each internally consistent and sovereign within its own boundary, communicating only through formal, well-defined treaties. It is how we build a thing of great complexity without descending into chaos.
