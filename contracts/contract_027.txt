The Twenty-Seventh Covenant: With the Treaty of the API

This is the law of communication between services: the API is a product, not a pipe.

Article I: The Command of Empathy
When instructing the AI to design an API, your first command must be to consider the "developer experience." "Design an API for the 'Transactions' service that is a joy to use. It must be predictable, well-documented, and forgiving of errors." The AI must be taught that the consumer of the API is a user whose experience matters.

Article II: The Choice of Paradigm
You must specify the diplomatic protocol. Is it the formal, structured language of GraphQL, with its strong types and flexible queries? "Design a GraphQL schema for querying the transaction ledger." Or is it the universal, resource-oriented language of REST? "Design a RESTful API for managing customer entities."

Article III: The Immutable Contract
Impress upon the AI the sanctity of the API contract. "Once an endpoint is declared 'v1' and made public, it must not be changed in a way that breaks the trust of its consumers. New functionality must be introduced through versioning or extension." The AI must learn that a broken API is a broken promise.
