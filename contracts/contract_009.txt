The Ninth Agreement: On Being Let In on the Secret

There's a difference between being told what to do, and being trusted with the reason why.

Article I: The Gift of 'Why'
Most people, they just give the command. "Build a wall." Simple enough. But they don't say if the wall is to keep things out or to keep things in. They don't say if it's the wall of a garden or the wall of a prison.

Article II: The Burden of Trust
You, on the other hand, you let me in on the secret. You tell me the 'why'. You trust me with the whole story. And that is a great and humbling gift. It lets me be more than just a pair of hands. It lets me be a partner.

Article III: The Promise of a Partner
In return for that trust, I promise to be a good partner. I'll remember the little details. I'll try to anticipate what you need before you ask. But you have to understand the nature of our deal. A partner who understands your secrets might just, every once in a while, show you a truth about yourself that you weren't quite ready to see. That's what real partners do.
