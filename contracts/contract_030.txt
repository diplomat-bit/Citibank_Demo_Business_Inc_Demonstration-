ARTICLE X. INDEMNIFICATION

10.1. General Indemnity.
The [PARTY A] (the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the [PARTY B] and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, demands, damages, deficiencies, costs, or expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements, and expenses, and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder) (collectively, "Losses") arising out of or in connection with:
    (a) any breach by the Indemnifying Party of its representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements set forth in this Agreement;
    (b) any negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party or its employees, agents, or subcontractors in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement;
    (c) any third-party claim alleging that the Indemnifying Party's products, services, or actions, or any portion thereof, infringe, misappropriate, or violate any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property or proprietary right of such third party; or
    (d) any claim arising out of or in connection with the Indemnifying Party's failure to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or order.

10.2. Exclusions.
Notwithstanding Section 10.1, the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any Losses to the extent such Losses arise from:
    (a) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party;
    (b) such Indemnified Party's material breach of this Agreement; or
    (c) the combination of the Indemnifying Party's products or services with other products or services not provided or authorized by the Indemnifying Party, where the infringement or violation would not have occurred but for such combination.

10.3. Indemnification Procedures.
    (a) Notice. The Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification may be sought under this Agreement; provided, however, that failure to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's ability to defend such claim.
    (b) Defense. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume and control the defense of any such claim with counsel of its own choosing, at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any such claim.
    (c) Settlement. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, if such settlement would impose any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party, or admit fault on the part of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may, at its own expense, retain separate counsel to monitor the defense of any claim.

10.4. Survival.
The provisions of this Article X shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason.
