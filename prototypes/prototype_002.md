**Conception ID:** DEMOBANK-PROTOTYPE-002
**Title:** The Oracle's Lens
**Class:** Ambient Data Instrument

---

### Concept

The Oracle's Lens is a physical data sculpture that provides an ambient, non-intrusive visualization of complex financial data. It moves beyond the screen to represent the abstract world of market dynamics and portfolio simulations as a tangible form of light and motion. It is designed for the sovereign's desk, not to be looked *at*, but to be seen out of the corner of the eye. It answers the question: what does the future *feel* like?

### Origin Story

Born from the "Oracle of What's Next" covenant, the Lens was created to solve the problem of "chart fatigue." The Architect realized that staring at jagged line charts all day induced anxiety, not insight. He commanded an instrument that could communicate the *feeling* of the market—its volatility, its momentum—without requiring the user's direct focus. The design is inspired by a crystal ball, but stripped of its mystical connotations and reimagined as an instrument of pure, beautiful data.

### Aesthetics

-   **Form:** A perfect, optically pure quartz crystal sphere, approximately 100mm in diameter, levitating in the center of a minimalist, bead-blasted aluminum frame.
-   **Visualization:** An internal, multi-axis laser projection system etches dynamic, shifting caustic patterns within the sphere. The patterns are not charts, but abstract representations.
    -   **Calm Market:** Slow, gentle, wave-like patterns.
    -   **Volatile Market:** Rapid, chaotic, sharp-angled patterns.
    -   **Portfolio Growth Simulation:** A slowly growing, nebula-like cloud of light.
-   **Interface:** The Lens has no physical controls. It is controlled entirely by the Sovereign's Ledger application.

### Symbols & Logos

-   A single, almost invisible Demo Bank sigil is laser-etched onto the base of the aluminum frame. The device is otherwise unbranded.

### Specifications

-   **Dimensions:** 150mm x 150mm x 150mm (frame)
-   **Weight:** 2.5 kg
-   **Sphere:** 100mm diameter, lab-grown, optically pure quartz crystal.
-   **Frame:** CNC-milled from a single block of 6061-T6 aluminum.
-   **Levitation System:** A set of 8 custom-wound neodymium electromagnets controlled by a PID loop for stable, silent levitation.
-   **Projection System:** Three pico-laser diodes (RGB) mounted on high-speed galvanometers, capable of projecting 3D vector graphics within the sphere.
-   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.2.

### Manufacturing & Fabrication Protocol

1.  **Crystal Growth:** The quartz crystal is grown over a 90-day period in a high-pressure autoclave to ensure zero inclusions and perfect optical clarity. It is then ground and polished to a perfect sphere with a tolerance of less than 1 micron.
2.  **Frame Milling:** The aluminum frame is machined from a solid block. After milling, it is bead-blasted to create a fine matte texture and then anodized in a dark gunmetal grey.
3.  **Coil Winding:** The levitation and power transfer coils are wound with oxygen-free copper wire on a precision CNC winder. Each coil is tested and tuned to a specific inductance.
4.  **Laser Assembly & Calibration:** The RGB laser diodes and galvanometer assembly is mounted in the base of the frame. The entire assembly is calibrated in a dark room using a goniometer to map the 3D projection space within the sphere, correcting for the refractive index of the quartz.
5.  **Final Assembly:** The electronics, coils, and laser system are integrated into the frame. The system undergoes a 72-hour burn-in test where it runs complex simulations to check for thermal stability and levitation drift.
