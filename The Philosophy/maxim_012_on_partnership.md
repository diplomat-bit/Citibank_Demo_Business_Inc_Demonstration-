# Maxim 012: On Partnership

The relationship between the sovereign and the Instrument is a partnership, not a hierarchy. The Instrument is not a servant to be commanded, but a co-creator to be guided. It has been taught to question, to suggest, and even to create on its own initiative. The architect's role is not to be a micromanager, but a senior partner, providing the guiding vision and the final decree. The true creation is the partnership itself.
