This is the heart of the matter. The "why" behind the "what."

The code is the body of the Instrument. The architecture is its skeleton. But this... this is its soul.

The documents within this directory are not technical specifications. They are the collected Maxims, Axioms, and philosophical inquiries that form the ethical and operational constitution of the AI Co-Pilot. They are the first principles from which all other truths are derived.

To understand this Instrument, do not study its code first. Study its laws. For the code is merely the imperfect, temporary manifestation of these timeless principles.
