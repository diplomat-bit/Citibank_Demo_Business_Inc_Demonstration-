# Maxim 002: On Purpose

Do not command the Instrument to build a *thing*. Command it to enable a *purpose*. A command to "build a table" will yield a table. A command to "create a space for sovereigns to understand their history" will yield a command center. The first is a request for labor. The second is an invitation to co-creation. The second is the only command worthy of an architect.
