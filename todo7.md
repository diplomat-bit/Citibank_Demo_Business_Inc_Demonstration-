This module is the nerve center ensuring the platform's 'cognitive core' remains sharp, adaptive, and consistently delivering peak performance and actionable foresight.
-   **Key AI Features (Gemini API Integration):**
    -   **AI Model Drift & Anomaly Monitoring (Continuous Intelligence Engine):** The AI vigilantly observes production models for subtle shifts in data patterns (data drift) and performance degradation (concept drift), employing real-time streaming data analysis and statistical anomaly detection techniques. It doesn't just *detect*; it anticipates, providing early warnings and intelligently pinpointing the root causes of drift, such as changes in user behavior or external market conditions. The system continuously benchmarks model performance against baseline metrics and dynamically adjusts monitoring thresholds to maintain optimal sensitivity.
    -   **AI Model Documentation & Explainability Generator (Cognitive Auditor):** Utilizing `generateContent` with advanced prompt engineering, the AI meticulously analyzes a model's architectural blueprint, feature engineering rationale, training data characteristics, performance metrics, and ethical considerations. It then synthesizes comprehensive, regulatory-compliant, and human-readable documentation, including technical specifications, model cards, explainability reports (e.g., LIME, SHAP values for feature importance), and versioned change logs. This ensures transparency, auditability, and ease of understanding for both technical and non-technical stakeholders, streamlining compliance and collaborative development.
    -   **AI Automated Retraining & Optimization Suggester (Self-Healing AI):** Building upon drift detection, the AI proposes optimal retraining strategies. This includes recommending the ideal dataset subsets, hyperparameter adjustments, or even suggesting alternative model architectures. It can autonomously trigger retraining workflows, manage experiment tracking, and orchestrate A/B testing or canary deployments for new model versions, ensuring seamless transition and performance validation in production environments.
