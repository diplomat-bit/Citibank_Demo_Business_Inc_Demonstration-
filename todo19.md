# The Sovereign Codex - Integration Plan, Part 19/10
## The Second Power Integration: The Autonomous Corporation Forge

### Vision
This document outlines the architecture for the second of the platform's two most powerful integration concepts: **The Autonomous Corporation Forge**. This system elevates the **Quantum Weaver** from a business incubator into a full-fledged company creation engine. It will integrate the **Quantum Weaver**, **Legal Suite**, and a new **Payment Gateway** module with best-in-class legal-tech and fintech APIs.

The goal is to create an AI-driven workflow where a user can:
1.  **Ideate:** Pitch a business idea to the Quantum Weaver and receive an AI-generated business plan.
2.  **Incorporate:** With one click, take that business plan and use the AI to file for legal incorporation as a C-Corp in Delaware via an API.
3.  **Capitalize:** Open a business bank account and issue founder's stock via APIs.
4.  **Operate:** Have a payment processing account and a capitalization table ready to go from day one.

This workflow transforms a user's idea into a legally sound, financially operational, and venture-ready corporation in a matter of minutes, almost entirely managed by the AI.

### Key Modules & External API Integrations

| Internal Module        | External Platform       | API Integration Purpose                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quantum Weaver**     | **Gemini API**          | Generate business plan, financial models, and strategic advice.     |
| **Legal Suite**        | **Stripe Atlas API**    | Programmatically file for legal incorporation in Delaware.        |
| **Payment Gateway**    | **Stripe Connect API**  | Create a new Stripe account for payment processing.               |
| **Legal Suite**        | **Clerky API**          | Generate and manage legal documents like board consents and NDAs.   |
| **New: Cap Table**     | **Carta API**           | Create a capitalization table and issue founder's stock.            |
| **New: Banking**       | **Mercury/Brex API**    | Programmatically open a business bank account.                      |

### Architectural Flow: From Idea to Incorporation

#### Step 1: Ideation (Quantum Weaver)
This step remains as defined previously. The user pitches their idea, and the AI generates a detailed business plan, a loan amount (simulated seed funding), and a coaching plan. The output is a structured `businessPlan` object.

#### Step 2: Incorporation (Legal Suite -> Stripe Atlas)
Once the user approves the business plan, a new "Incorporate this Business" button appears.

1.  **Gather Information:** The UI presents a simple form asking for Founder names and addresses, pre-filled where possible.
2.  **Call Incorporation Service:** A backend service takes the `businessPlan` object and the founder info and makes a single API call to Stripe Atlas.

- **Code Example (Conceptual - Go Backend Service):**
  ```go
  // services/incorporation_service.go
  package services

  import (
      "bytes"
      "encoding/json"
      "net/http"
      "os"
  )

  // Stripe Atlas API is not public, so this is a conceptual model of how it would work.
  func IncorporateWithStripeAtlas(businessPlan map[string]interface{}, founders []map[string]string) (string, error) {
      atlasAPIKey := os.Getenv("STRIPE_ATLAS_API_KEY")
      endpoint := "https://api.stripe.com/v1/atlas/incorporations"

      payload := map[string]interface{}{
          "company_name": businessPlan["name"],
          "product_description": businessPlan["summary"],
          "founders": founders,
          "entity_type": "c_corp",
          "state": "DE",
      }
      jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(payload)

      req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", endpoint, bytes.NewBuffer(jsonData))
      req.Header.Add("Authorization", "Bearer " + atlasAPIKey)
      req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")

      // ... execute request and handle response ...
      // On success, Stripe Atlas would return a corporation ID and begin the async process.
      // We would receive webhooks about the status (e.g., 'incorporated', 'ein_issued').
      return "incorp_123abc", nil
  }
  ```

#### Step 3: Financial & Legal Setup (Multiple Services)
Upon receiving a webhook from Stripe Atlas that incorporation is complete and an EIN (Employer Identification Number) has been issued, a series of automated actions are triggered.

1.  **Open Bank Account:** The backend calls the Mercury or Brex API with the new company's legal name and EIN to programmatically open a business bank account.
2.  **Setup Payments:** The backend calls the Stripe Connect API to create a new connected Stripe account for the new corporation, enabling it to accept payments.
3.  **Issue Stock:** The backend calls the Carta API to:
    a. Create a new company profile.
    b. Create a capitalization table.
    c. Issue founder stock grants to the founders as specified in the initial setup.

- **Code Example (Conceptual - TypeScript, Carta API Client):**
  ```typescript
  // services/carta_client.ts
  import axios from 'axios';

  const CARTA_API_TOKEN = process.env.CARTA_API_TOKEN;

  // Carta API is also not fully public for this, so this is a conceptual model.
  export async function issueFounderStock(companyId: string, founderEmail: string, shareCount: number) {
    const endpoint = `https://api.carta.com/v1/companies/${companyId}/stock_grants`;
    const payload = {
      grantee_email: founderEmail,
      share_count: shareCount,
      grant_type: 'founder_common',
      issue_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
    };

    await axios.post(endpoint, payload, {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${CARTA_API_TOKEN}` }
    });
    console.log(`Issued ${shareCount} shares to ${founderEmail} on Carta.`);
  }
  ```

#### Step 4: Hand-off to Command Center
The workflow is complete. The user is redirected to a new **Corporate Dashboard** for their newly created company. This dashboard now shows:
- A "Legal Docs" widget (powered by Clerky/Stripe Atlas) containing their incorporation certificate and bylaws.
- A "Banking" widget (powered by Mercury) showing their new bank account balance.
- A "Payments" widget (powered by Stripe) ready to be configured.
- A "Cap Table" widget (powered by Carta) showing the founder's equity.

### UI/UX Integration
- The **Quantum Weaver**'s final "Approved" screen will feature a prominent "Incorporate this Business" call-to-action.
- The **Legal Suite** will gain a new section for "Corporate Formation" that tracks the status of the Stripe Atlas application.
- Two new modules, **Cap Table** and **Banking**, will be added to the sidebar under the "Corporate" heading, which become active once the company is formed.
- A new **Payment Gateway** module will allow configuration of the Stripe account.
