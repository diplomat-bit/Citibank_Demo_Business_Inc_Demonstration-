# Engineering Vision Specification: Credit Health

## 1. Core Philosophy: "The Weight of Your Name"

A credit score is not just a number; it is the quantifiable echo of your reliability, a history of promises kept. This module's purpose is to demystify this often-opaque concept, transforming it from a source of anxiety into a transparent, understandable system. It provides the tools to tend to the strength of one's financial name.

## 2. Key Features & Functionality

*   **Credit Score Display:** A large, clear display of the user's current credit score and recent changes.
*   **Factor Analysis:** A detailed breakdown of the key factors influencing the score (e.g., Payment History, Credit Utilization).
*   **Radar Chart Visualization:** A visual representation of the user's strengths and weaknesses across the different credit factors.
*   **AI-Powered Tip:** A single, actionable tip generated by the AI to help the user improve their score.

## 3. AI Integration (Gemini API)

*   **AI Tip Generation:** The system sends the user's current score and the status of their credit factors (e.g., "Payment History: Excellent, Credit Mix: Fair") to `gemini-2.5-flash`. The prompt asks the AI to provide one concise, actionable tip for improvement, focusing on the weakest factor.
*   **AI Simulator (Conceptual):** A future feature could allow users to ask, "What would happen to my score if I paid off my credit card?" The AI would provide a simulated score change and an explanation.

## 4. Primary Data Models

*   **`CreditScore`:** Contains the `score`, `change`, and overall `rating`.
*   **`CreditFactor`:** A structured object with a `name`, `status` (Excellent, Good, etc.), and a `description`.

## 5. Technical Architecture

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Component:** `CreditHealthView.tsx`
    *   **State Management:** Consumes `creditScore` and `creditFactors` from `DataContext`.
    *   **Key Libraries:** `recharts` for the RadarChart.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Primary Service:** `credit-api`
    *   **Key Endpoints:**
        *   `GET /api/credit/report`: This endpoint would securely connect to a real credit bureau (e.g., Experian, TransUnion) via their API to fetch the user's credit data.
        *   `POST /api/credit/ai-tip`: The endpoint that powers the AI tip generation.
