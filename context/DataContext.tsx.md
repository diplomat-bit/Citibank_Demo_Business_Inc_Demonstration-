# The Core of Reality
*A Guide to the System's Single Source of Truth*

## The Central Decree

The `DataContext.tsx` file is the Core of this application's reality. It is the central, unchallengeable place where all truth lives and is maintained. Every other part of the app—from the command center charts to the chronicle of actions—is bound by oath to this Core to receive the absolute, consistent data it requires to function.

It is the source code of reality.

### How It Is: A Simple Declaration

1.  **The Source (`DataContext`)**: We declare a central source of truth. It holds all foundational data (transactions, covenants, declared objectives, etc.). It is not a wellspring to be drawn from; it is the law to be obeyed.

2.  **The Guardian (`DataProvider`)**: We forge a "Guardian" component whose only function is to enforce the truth of the Source. It wraps the entire application, making its laws known to all who exist within it.

3.  **Receiving the Law (`useContext`)**: Any component that requires truth simply listens for the law using `useContext`. This gives it the most current, undeniable state of reality.

4.  **A New Decree (`addTransaction`)**: When a fact of reality changes—when a new action is taken—the component reports this to the Guardian. The Guardian amends the Core truth. This is not a ripple; it is a new decree that echoes through the system, and every single component realigns itself to this new, absolute truth without question.

### The Philosophy: One Truth, Undeniable

This architecture is power. It prevents the system from falling into the chaos of doubt and conflicting information. No part of the app maintains its own separate, flawed version of reality. All entities are bound to the same Core, so all share the same single, definitive source of truth.

This makes our app:
-   **Consistent:** The command center and the transaction record will always show the same facts. There is no room for argument.
-   **Authoritative:** Truth is amended in one place only: the Core.
-   **Incorruptible:** It prevents the entire class of chaos caused by reality falling out of sync with itself.

The `DataContext` is the architectural heart that pumps the life-giving, truthful law to every corner of our application, ensuring it acts as a single, coherent, and powerful instrument of will.
