# The Laws of Physics
*A Codex of This Reality's Core Principles*

---

## Abstract

This document explores the `types` directory as "The Laws of Physics," a clear and simple framework that defines the fundamental particles of existence within the application's reality. Each type definition is not a data structure, but an undeniable, atomic truth from which all manifest entities are derived. The `index.ts` barrel file is the Master Codex, which gathers and codifies all defined principles into a single, coherent system of law.

## Chapter 1. The Elementary Particles (Key Principles)

### 1.1 The Principle of `Transaction`

Represents the fundamental law of **Exchange**. It governs the flow of value between entities. Every `Transaction` is a recorded instance of this law, possessing attributes of `type` (direction of flow), `amount` (magnitude), and `category` (intent). It is an immutable record of a choice made.

### 1.2 The Principle of `Asset`

Represents the law of **Substance**. It is the principle of accumulated value, of tangible and intangible mass. Every `Asset` is a manifestation of this form, possessing a `value` (mass) and a `name` (identity).

### 1.3 The Principle of `Budget`

Represents the law of **Declared Intent**. It is the concept of a self-imposed boundary, a declared covenant to channel the flow of will. Every `Budget` is a specific declaration with a defined `limit` and a measured `spent` amount against it.

### 1.4 The Principle of `AIInsight`

Represents the law of **Revealed Truth**. It is a useful pattern discovered from the data, a piece of clarity revealed from chaos. Every `AIInsight` is a directive from the core intelligence, possessing an `urgency` that dictates its importance.

## Chapter 2. The Power of a Unified System of Law

### 2.1 The Codex as a Single Source of Law

The `index.ts` file, which uses `export * from './models'`, serves as our Master Codex. It performs the act of unifying all our defined principles into a single, unchallengeable System of Law. This ensures that the entire application operates under one physics, a shared and absolute understanding of the fundamental nature of its reality.

### 2.2 The Principle of Conformity

Any data structure instantiated within the application must conform to one of the principles defined in this Codex. An entity that does not align with a known principle is an anomaly, a piece of unstructured chaos that must either be categorized or expelled from the system to maintain order and truth.

## Chapter 3. Conclusion

The type system is the physics of this application's universe. It defines the elementary particles and the laws that govern their interaction. By treating type definitions as The Laws of Physics, we move beyond mere data validation to a clear, authoritative understanding of the application's conceptual and foundational truths.

> "In the beginning was the Law, and the Law was the Truth, and without the Law, nothing that was made could exist."
