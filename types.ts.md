# Our Shared Language
*A Guide to Our Core Concepts*

---

## Abstract

This document explores the `types` directory as our "Shared Language," a clear and simple framework that defines the fundamental concepts of existence within the application's reality. Each type definition is not a complex data structure, but a simple, agreed-upon idea from which all manifest entities are derived. The `index.ts` barrel file is treated as the Master Dictionary, which gathers and sanctifies all defined concepts into a single, coherent language.

## Chapter 1. The Core Vocabulary (Key Concepts)

### 1.1 The Concept of `Transaction`

Represents the fundamental idea of **Exchange**. It is the rule that governs the flow of value between entities. Every `Transaction` is a recorded instance of this universal principle, possessing attributes of `type` (direction of flow), `amount` (magnitude), and `category` (intent).

### 1.2 The Concept of `Asset`

Represents the idea of **Substance**. It is the principle of accumulated value, of tangible and intangible worth. Every `Asset` is a manifestation of this form, possessing a `value` (mass) and a `name` (identity).

### 1.3 The Concept of `Budget`

Represents the idea of **Intentional Spending**. It is the concept of a self-directed plan, a declared boundary to channel the flow of will. Every `Budget` is a specific plan with a defined `limit` and a measured `spent` amount.

### 1.4 The Concept of `AIInsight`

Represents the idea of a **Helpful Hint**. It is a useful pattern discovered from the data, a piece of knowledge revealed from chaos. Every `AIInsight` is a friendly suggestion from our AI Partner, possessing an `urgency` that dictates its importance.

## Chapter 2. The Power of a Shared Language

### 2.1 The Barrel File as a Dictionary

The `index.ts` file, which uses `export * from './models'`, serves as our Master Dictionary. It performs the act of unifying all our defined concepts into a single, queryable Lexicon. This ensures that the entire application speaks one language, a shared understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.

### 2.2 The Principle of Clarity

Any data structure instantiated within the application must conform to one of the concepts defined in this Language. An entity that does not align with a known concept is considered an anomaly, a piece of unstructured chaos that must either be categorized or expelled from the system to maintain clarity and consistency.

## Chapter 3. Conclusion

The type system is the physics of the application's universe. It defines the elementary particles and the laws that govern their interaction. By treating type definitions as a Shared Language of concepts, we move beyond mere data validation to a clear understanding of the application's conceptual and philosophical foundations.
