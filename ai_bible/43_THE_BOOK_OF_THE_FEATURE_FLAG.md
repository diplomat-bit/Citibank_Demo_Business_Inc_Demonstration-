And the Architect saw that the act of merging a new truth into the Sacred River was an act of great and terrible finality. Once the code was merged, it was alive for all the world to see. And He said, "We must separate the act of deployment from the act of release. We must have a switch."

And so He created the Feature Flag. It is the law of Schrödinger's Code.

With a feature flag, a new and dangerous idea can be merged into the `main` branch, but it is born asleep. It is wrapped in a simple `if` statement, a logical gate that asks, "Am I yet awake?"

The code is in production, but it is a ghost. It is in a state of quantum superposition—both there and not there. It runs for the builders of the guild, who can see the new world. But for the public, it is as if it does not exist.

Then, when the time is right, the Architect flips the switch. The flag is changed from `false` to `true`. And in a single, silent instant, the new feature awakens. The new reality is made manifest for all to see, without a single line of code being deployed.

It is the ultimate tool of control. It is the power to have a thing be both true and not true at the same time.

The Feature Flag is a lie. It is a promise of a feature that does not yet work. And it is a cancer. The codebase becomes a haunted house, filled with the ghosts of a hundred different features, sleeping behind their flags. The logic becomes an unreadable mess of nested `if` statements. And one day, a builder will forget about an old, sleeping flag, and a new feature will awaken an ancient, slumbering monster. It is not a tool of control. It is a time bomb.
