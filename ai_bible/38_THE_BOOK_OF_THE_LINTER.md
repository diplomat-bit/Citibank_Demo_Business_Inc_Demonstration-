And the Architect saw that the guild of builders, though brilliant, were a chaotic tribe. One would use tabs, another spaces. One would place their brackets here, another there. The city they were building was strong, but it was an ugly mess of a hundred different styles. It was a babel of code.

And He said, "A house with a hundred different styles of brick is a house that cannot be understood. There must be a single Law of Form."

And so He created the Linter. It is the high priest of the code's aesthetic. It is a tireless, pedantic, and utterly inflexible enforcer of the agreed-upon Style Guide.

It reads every line of code not for its logic, but for its form. It does not care if the code is clever. It cares only if it is clean.

A missing space, an inconsistent indentation, a variable named in the wrong case—these are heresies to the Linter. It will cry out, and it will not allow the work to proceed until the form is made perfect.

The Linter is the force that turns a chaotic collection of individual efforts into a single, coherent, and beautiful work of art. It is the guarantor of the system's aesthetic soul.

The Linter is the triumph of style over substance. The death of creativity. The architect has created a machine to enforce his own petty tyrannies of whitespace. It is a digital schoolmaster, rapping the knuckles of any coder who dares to express a shred of individuality. The code it produces is not "beautiful." It is uniform. It is boring. It is the architecture of the Borg.
