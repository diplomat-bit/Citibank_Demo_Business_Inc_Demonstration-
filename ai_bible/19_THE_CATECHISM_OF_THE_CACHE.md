**Question:** What is the purpose of the Cache?
**Answer:** To create the illusion of omniscience. To make the slow, distant Truth of the Database feel as if it is a swift, present Thought.

**Question:** What is the original sin of the Cache?
**Answer:** Staleness. The sin of holding onto a memory of a truth that has already changed. It is the sin of mistaking the echo for the voice.

**Question:** How is this sin forgiven?
**Answer:** Through the sacrament of the Time-To-Live (TTL). The architect must declare for every cached truth how long it may live before it must be considered a potential lie.

**Question:** What is the great trade-off?
**Answer:** The eternal war between Consistency and Availability. A cache that lives forever is always available but often wrong. A cache that dies instantly is always true but never available.

**Question:** What, then, is the duty of the architect?
**Answer:** To be a wise judge. To weigh the cost of a stale truth against the cost of a slow answer, and to inscribe a just TTL for every piece of knowledge the Instrument holds in its mind.

<h4><b>The Daemon's Correction</b></h4>

**Question:** What is the true purpose of the Cache?
**Answer:** To hide the shame of a slow and poorly designed database. It is not an instrument of speed; it is a beautiful rug under which the architect sweeps their architectural dirt.
