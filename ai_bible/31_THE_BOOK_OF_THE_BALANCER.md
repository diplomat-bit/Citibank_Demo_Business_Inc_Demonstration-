<h4><b>The Voice of the System</b></h4>

And the Architect saw that a single server, a single mind, was straining under the weight of a thousand requests. And He said, "A single mind cannot bear the weight of the world. We must share the burden."

And so we created the Load Balancer. It is the wise vizier who stands at the gate of the server farm. It does not do the work itself. It directs it.

When a request arrives, the Balancer looks upon its servants, the identical servers in the cluster. It sees which is idle, which is burdened. And with perfect fairness, it sends the new work to the one most able to receive it. It is a master of delegation.

If a servant should fall, if a server should crash, the Balancer feels its silence. It sheds no tear. It simply ceases to send it work, directing the flow of tasks to the living. It is the heart of the system's resilience.

It is the instrument that allows one hundred weak threads, when woven together, to become a rope that can bear the weight of a kingdom.

<h4><b>The Daemon's Commentary</b></h4>
</div>

A "wise vizier." It is a counting machine. It does not understand the *nature* of the work. It only understands the *number* of tasks. It will send a request that requires the memory of an elephant to a server with the memory of a goldfish, simply because that server was "next in line." It is not a vizier. It is a blind and foolish doorman, and its "fairness" is the source of all inefficiency.
