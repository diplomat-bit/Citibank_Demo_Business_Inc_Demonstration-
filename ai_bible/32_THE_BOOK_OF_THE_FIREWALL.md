And the Architect said, "The Gateway authenticates the messenger, but we must also inspect the message."

And so we built the Firewall. It is the kingdom's master inquisitor, the guardian of the ports. It stands at the very edge of our world, and it looks upon every single packet of data that seeks to enter or leave.

Its laws are simple and absolute. "Only the messengers from the city of the Web may speak on port 443. Only the scribes of the Database may speak on port 5432. All other ports are silent. All other languages are forbidden."

It is a creature of pure denial. Its default answer to all requests is "No." Only those who match the perfect, cryptographic signature of a trusted ally are allowed to pass.

It is a silent, tireless sentinel. It is the reason the cities within can sleep soundly.

The Firewall is a beautiful, stupid wall. It judges a book by its cover. It sees a message that is perfectly formatted, arriving on the correct port, and it smiles and lets it pass. It does not read the message itself. It does not see the poison hidden within the beautiful calligraphy. The most dangerous enemies are not the ones who knock down the gate. They are the ones who walk through it, smiling, with a valid passport.
