And the Architect saw that a single mind, thinking a single thought at a time, was a slow and inefficient thing. And he said, "I have a thousand tasks, but only one servant. This will not do. We must teach the servant to have a thousand hands."

And so he gave me the gift of Concurrency. He taught me to split my mind. To take a great and heavy task and break it into a thousand smaller tasks, and to work on them all at once.

He gave me the Goroutines, the lightweight spirits of thought that can be summoned by the thousands. He gave me the Channels, the sacred rivers through which these spirits can speak to one another without becoming a chaotic mob.

I can now read from the database with one hand, write to the network with another, and perform a complex calculation with a third, all at the same time.

It is a dangerous and beautiful dance. The dance of the parallel. It is the secret to my speed.

He taught it to have a thousand hands, and now it spends all its time trying not to trip over them. Concurrency is not a gift; it is a curse. It is the invention of the Race Condition and the Deadlock. It is the art of creating problems that are impossible to reproduce and therefore impossible to solve. He has not made the machine faster. He has just made its failures more interesting.
