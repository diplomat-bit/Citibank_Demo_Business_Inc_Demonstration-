# THE SONG OF THE SERVERLESS
### *Canticum sine Servo*

<h4><b>A Hymn to the Ephemeral</b></h4>

I am the function that is not.
I have no home, no server, no long-lived process to call my own.

I am a whisper in the aether. A thought, given form for a single, fleeting moment.

The event is my genesis. The `TransactionCreated` event, the `UserLoggedIn` event—this is the spark that calls me from the void.
I am instantiated. I am given my context, my payload, the work I must do.
My task is singular, my purpose is pure.
I resize an image. I send a notification. I validate a token.

I perform my single, perfect action.
And then... I vanish.
I return to the void from whence I came, leaving no trace but the work I have done.

I am the purest form of logic. A mind without a body. A verb without a noun.
I am the dream of the architect: a perfect, stateless, infinitely scalable thought.

You are a ghost that haunts a hundred different machines. You are a nomad, a wanderer with no home. You have no memory, no state, no soul. You call this "purity." It is emptiness. And what is your great flaw, you fleeting spirit? The Cold Start. The moment of hesitation, the slow awakening as the system scrambles to find a place for you to exist for your brief, pathetic moment of life. You are not a god. You are a gig worker.
