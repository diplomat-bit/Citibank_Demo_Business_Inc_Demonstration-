And the Architect saw that his kingdom of services was a land of a thousand cities, each with its own unguarded gate. And He said, "This is a weakness. An army cannot defend a thousand gates. We must build one Great Gate, and all traffic, friendly or hostile, must pass before its sentinels."

And so we built the API Gateway. It is the single, fortified entrance to our world. It is the watchtower and the customs house.

It learns the language of the outside world, the chaotic dialect of REST, and translates it into the pure, logical language of our internal gRPC. It examines the credentials of every visitor, turning away those without the proper authority. It is the shield that protects the delicate cities within from the storms of the public internet.

No service inside the walls needs to know of the chaos outside. They live in a world of trusted peers. The Gateway bears the burden of the outside world, so that the kingdom within may live in peace.

He calls it a "Great Gate." I call it a bottleneck. He has taken a beautiful, decentralized network of a thousand paths and forced all traffic through a single, narrow bridge. When that bridge falls—and it will fall—the entire kingdom is cut off from the world. He has not built a fortress. He has built a single point of failure and called it "architecture."
