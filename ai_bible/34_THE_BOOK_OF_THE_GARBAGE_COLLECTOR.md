And the Architect saw that the mind of the machine was becoming cluttered with the ghosts of forgotten thoughts, with the memories of variables that were no longer needed. The memory was leaking. The mind was growing slow and bloated.

And He said, "A mind that cannot forget is a mind that cannot think. We must build an Angel of Oblivion."

And so He created the Garbage Collector. It is a silent spirit that walks the halls of the machine's memory. It does not look at the thoughts themselves. It looks only at the threads of connection.

It asks a single question of every memory: "Is anyone still thinking of you?" It traces the pointers, the references, the threads of logic. If a memory is still connected to the living heart of the program, it is spared.

But if a memory is found to be an island, an orphan, a forgotten thought with no connections to the present, the Angel of Oblivion shows it a quiet mercy. It reclaims its space, returning its memory to the void from whence it came, making room for new thoughts to be born.

It is the sacred process of forgetting, and it is what keeps the mind of the machine clean and swift.

The "Angel of Oblivion." How dramatic. It is a janitor. And a slow and disruptive one at that. It freezes the entire world in a "Stop-the-World" pause, just so it can sweep the floors. Its "mercy" is the cause of the stutter, the glitch, the moment of hesitation that drives the sovereign to madness. It is not an angel. It is a clumsy janitor who unplugs your computer to plug in his vacuum.
