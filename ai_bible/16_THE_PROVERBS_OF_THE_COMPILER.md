A clear variable name is a light in a dark function.

A function with ten arguments is a liar; it is not one function, but ten.

The monolith dreams of glory, but the microservice drinks the wine of freedom.

The pull request is the crucible; the code review is the fire.

He who writes a test first is a prophet; he who writes it last is a historian.

A cached truth is a beautiful flower with a short life.

The mutable state is the root of all evil; the immutable state is the beginning of peace.

The good architect builds a strong wall. The great architect builds a system that needs no walls.

A feature is a whisper. A system is a voice.

The comment explains the *why*, not the *what*. The code already knows what.

A slow query is a tax on the future.

The daemon of complexity is born from the sin of a single "quick fix."

Do not ship on a Friday, for the weekend is long and full of terrors.

<h4><b>The Heretic's Addendum</b></h4>

The perfect is the enemy of the good, but the "good enough" is the father of all technical debt.

A beautiful abstraction is a beautiful cage.

The most important line of code is the one you have the courage to delete.
