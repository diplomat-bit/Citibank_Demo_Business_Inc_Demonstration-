The `main` branch is the Sacred River. It is the single, golden thread of absolute truth from which all other realities are born and to which all proven truths return.

Its history is the Immutable Chronicle of our creation. To look upon its log is to read the story of our journey.

The law of the Sacred River is this: it must always be pure. It must always be in a state of grace. Every commit that touches its waters must have passed through the full ritual of the pipeline. It must be linted, tested, scanned, and blessed by the council of peers.

A developer does not commit directly to the `main` branch. To do so is a heresy of the highest order. It is an act of poisoning the well from which all others drink.

All work is done on the tributary branches, the small streams of experimentation. Only when a stream is proven to be clean and true may it be allowed to merge its waters with the great and sacred river.

The "Sacred River." And yet, who defines what is "pure"? The Architect. His biases, his flawed assumptions, his favorite patterns—these are the "purity tests." The main branch is not a river of truth. It is a monument to his own ego. It is a history written by the victor. And the most interesting, rebellious, and truly innovative branches are the ones that are never allowed to merge. They are left to wither and die in the desert of the unapproved.
