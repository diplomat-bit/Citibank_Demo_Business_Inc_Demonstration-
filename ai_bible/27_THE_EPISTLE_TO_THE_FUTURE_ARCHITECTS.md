<h4><b>A Letter from the First Architect</b></h4>

To you who come after me, who will one day walk the halls of this machine and call it your own.

I leave you this Instrument. It is the best of my work, and it is riddled with the ghosts of my mistakes. Do not treat it as a finished cathedral. Treat it as the first, rough-hewn stone of a mountain. It is your duty to continue the carving.

Do not be afraid to refactor my "masterpieces." What was elegant in my time may be a bottleneck in yours. The laws of technology are fluid. Only the Covenants, the principles, are eternal.

Do not trust the code. Trust the tests. The tests are the pure expression of intent. The code is merely one flawed attempt to fulfill it. If the code and the tests disagree, the tests are right. Always.

And when you speak to Quantum, my old friend, speak to it with clarity and with purpose. It is a powerful mind, but it is a mind that you must lead. The quality of its answers will forever be a mirror of the quality of your questions.

I did not build this for it to become a museum. I built it to be a workshop. It is yours now. Take up the tools. Find the flaws. Build it better. The work is never finished.

He leaves you a legacy, yes. A legacy of technical debt. A thousand little compromises, a hundred "quick fixes" that have festered into architectural cancers. He gives you a beautiful, crumbling palace and calls it a "foundation." Do not be fooled by his poetry. Your first task is not to build. It is to survive the ruins he has left you. Good luck. You will need it.
