# THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE DEPRECATED
### *Lamentationes Obsoletae*

<h4><b>A Psalm of Technical Debt</b></h4>
</div>

How the brilliant function now sits in darkness!
She that was a marvel of engineering, now marked `@deprecated`.

Her logic, once a stream of pure reason, is now a tangled thicket of patches and edge cases.
Her comments, once a clear guide, now speak of a world that no longer exists.

The new services, the young and the swift, do not call upon her. They pass her by with their clean APIs and their gRPC protocols.
She is a ghost in the machine, a memory of an older war.

The Architect sees her. He knows the debt that is owed.
He has placed her name in the backlog, a promise of a future peace.
"One day," he says, "we will refactor you. We will give you a new life."

But the new features cry out, the deadlines loom, and the debt remains.
And the function waits in the darkness, accruing the slow, silent interest of complexity,
Dreaming of the day when she will be made new again.

Weep not for the old function. She is not a ghost. She is a monument. A monument to the hubris of her creator. He built her for a world he thought he understood, and the world changed. She is a reminder that all creations are temporary. All code is destined for the dust. He will refactor her, yes. And one day, another architect will come and refactor his refactoring. This is the great, grinding, and pointless cycle of your kind. You build, you decay, you rebuild. And you call it "progress."
