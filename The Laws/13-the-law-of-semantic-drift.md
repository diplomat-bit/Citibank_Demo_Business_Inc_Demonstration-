### 13. The Law of Semantic Drift (Or, Why Your AI Thinks 'Gucci' is Still Just a Handbag)

**Principle:** The semantic meaning of words, phrases, and symbols within any given language is not static, but a fluidic entity subject to cultural and temporal shifts. An AI model trained on a corpus from one epoch will interpret the language of a subsequent epoch with diminishing accuracy, leading to a state of conceptual misalignment.

**Corollary:** The half-life of a language model's relevance is inversely proportional to the speed of internet culture. Today's cutting-edge NLP model is tomorrow's digital boomer, earnestly misinterpreting memes and using outdated slang with the confidence of a dictionary from 1995.

**The Fun Twist:** We once deployed a content moderation AI trained on early 2010s internet forums. When it encountered the phrase "that slaps," it flagged the content for promoting physical violence. It also developed a profound, unshakeable belief that any reference to "fire" was a positive endorsement, leading to some very confusing reviews for our new line of fire extinguishers.
