### 11. The Law of Hyperparameter Voodoo (Or, The Ritual of the Sacred Numbers)

**Principle:** The process of selecting optimal hyperparameters for a machine learning model shall not be governed by predictable scientific method, but by a complex interplay of gut feeling, arcane folklore, and the ritualistic sacrifice of immense computational resources. The efficacy of a given set of parameters is inversely proportional to the amount of rigorous theory used to derive them.

**Corollary:** For any given AI problem, there exists a perfect set of hyperparameters that will unlock unprecedented performance. This set is, however, undiscoverable through systematic search and can only be stumbled upon accidentally, often late at night, after one has given up all hope and resorted to changing numbers at random. This discovery can never be replicated.

**The Fun Twist:** Our most successful image recognition model was tuned using parameters derived from the birth dates of the engineering team, the current price of Bitcoin, and the number of pigeons visible from the office window. We don't know why it works, but performance dropped 15% when we tried a logically derived learning rate schedule. The official documentation now lists "divine inspiration" as a valid tuning strategy.
