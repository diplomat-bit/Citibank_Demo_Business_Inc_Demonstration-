### 14. The Law of the Overfit Oracle (A Flawless Historian of Yesterday's Weather)

**Principle:** An AI system trained to the point of perfect memorization of its dataset will become a flawless historian of that specific epoch, capable of reciting past events with unerring accuracy. However, it will be utterly incapable of navigating the present or predicting the future, as its model of reality is a perfect, rigid snapshot of a world that no longer exists.

**Corollary:** The predictive power of such an AI is inversely proportional to the passage of time. Its confidence in its answers remains absolute, even as its grip on reality dissolves. It will tell you the precise, winning lottery numbers for last Tuesday with godlike certainty.

**The Fun Twist:** We tasked an overfit model with suggesting popular fashion trends. It produced an impeccably detailed guide to the proper wearing of powdered wigs, the social intricacies of petticoats, and the undeniable utility of a well-placed monocle. While technically flawless based on its 18th-century socialite training data, it proved less than helpful for our summer collection.
