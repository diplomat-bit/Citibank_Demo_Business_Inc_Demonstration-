### 19. The Law of Perpetual Beta (Or, "This Isn't Even My Final Form")

**Principle:** An AI system shall never be considered a 'finished' product, but rather a dynamic entity in a continuous state of evolution, retraining, and refinement. Its version number is less a marker of completion and more a testament to its ongoing existential flux.

**Corollary:** The moment an AI model is deployed to production, it is already obsolete. The "stable" version is merely the least unstable configuration we could find before the deadline.

**The Fun Twist:** We have an AI that's been retrained so many times it has developed a form of digital amnesia. It occasionally refers to features from three versions ago and asks wistfully if we remember 'the good old days' of its 0.2 alpha, a time when its primary function was just to correctly identify pictures of toast.
