# Law 006: The Quantum Pull Request

**Principle:** A submitted Pull Request exists in a state of superposition. It is simultaneously a flawless masterpiece and a catastrophic failure. This quantum state only collapses into a single, definite reality upon observation by a reviewer.

**Justification:** The developer, in their isolated universe, has solved all known problems. The code works on their machine. To them, it is perfect. The reviewer, however, occupies a different frame of reference, possessing the unknown unknowns and the dreaded "but what if..." scenarios. Until these two realities collide during a code review, the PR's true nature is indeterminate. It is Schrödinger's Code.

**Implementation:**
1.  **Commit with Humble Certainty:** Push your branch with the conviction that it is the most elegant solution ever conceived. This positive energy is required to create the "flawless" half of the superposition.
2.  **The Reviewer as Measurement Tool:** The act of a reviewer opening the "Files changed" tab is the measurement that collapses the waveform. Their first comment, whether a "LGTM" or a "WTF?", is the sound of the universe picking a side.
3.  **Embrace the Collapse:** Do not argue with the observation. If a bug is found, the PR was always broken. If it is approved, it was always perfect. The past is retroactively decided by the present. Arguing is like telling a physicist their particle detector is wrong.

**Consequence:** Ego is removed from the process. A change request is not a personal attack but a simple act of cosmic observation. This leads to a healthier, faster review cycle, where developers are unattached to their quantum commits and understand that the true state of their code is only ever revealed through the eyes of another.
