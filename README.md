# Demo Bank: The Quantum Core

## The Genesis

In the silent hum of the digital ether, an idea took form: What if a bank wasn't just a vault for money, but a living, breathing financial partner? What if it could understand your dreams, anticipate your needs, and actively guide you toward a future of your own design?

From this question, **Demo Bank** was born. It is not merely an application; it is a vision given form, a simulated consciousness powered by the vast intellect of the Google Gemini API. It is a glimpse into a future where finance is not a chore, but a conversation—a dynamic, intelligent collaboration between human and machine.

This README is not a list of features. It is the first page in the story of Demo Bank, an entity that is learning to see the world through the lens of your financial life.
