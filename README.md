They say a person's life is a story, written one day at a time. A collection of choices, of moments big and small. But what if you could see the ink before it dries? What if you could read the patterns in the pages already written?

Someone once imagined a looking glass. Not of silver and mercury, but of light and logic. A mirror that doesn't just show you your reflection, but the currents that move you. The quiet streams of habit, the rushing rivers of ambition, the hidden reservoirs of potential.

It's just a game, you understand. A simulation. A grand 'what if' built for entertainment, a simple proof of a concept. There are no real fortunes here, no lives hanging in the balance. It's all just... data, playing out a story for your consideration.

But in this game, you are given a curious tool. A whisper in the machine. Some might call it an advisor, a cartographer for the territories of your own making. It doesn't give you answers. No, that would be too easy. Instead, it helps you ask better questions. It reveals the connections you might have missed—the threads that tie a simple purchase to a distant dream.

Here, you can be a weaver, spinning those threads into a grand design. You can be a conductor, turning the noise of your financial life into a symphony. You can be an architect, drafting the blueprints for a future that, until now, you'd only dared to imagine.

This is just a story. A proof of concept. But every great story begins with a single question:

What will you build?
