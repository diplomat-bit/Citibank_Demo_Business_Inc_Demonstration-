# The Sovereign Codex
### A Unified Field Theory of the Demo Bank Application

---

## Abstract

This document provides a complete ontological and architectural blueprint of the Demo Bank application. It models the system not as a collection of code, but as a living entity—a "Vessel of Being"—designed to function as a **Sovereign Financial Agent** for the user, herein referred to as "The Visionary."

We formalize the application's structure using a metaphysical framework where:
-   **Data** is the *Primordial Memory*, the foundational story from which reality is born.
-   **Types** are the *Lexicon of Being*, the immutable Platonic Forms of all entities.
-   **Components** are *Perceptual Frames*, the windows through which reality is observed.
-   **The UI** is the *Manifest Reality*, the tangible expression of the system's consciousness.
-   **The AI** is the *Oracle*, a partner in creation and an extension of the user's sovereign will.

This codex will detail every file, from the foundational `index.html` (The Silent Stage) to the highest-level command centers, explaining its role within this unified field theory. It is the definitive guide to the philosophy, architecture, and purpose of the Instrument.

## Part I: The Foundational Layer & Genesis Protocol

### `index.html`: The Architecture of the Vessel
> *The architect does not build the house. The architect builds the blueprint. The house then builds itself.*

This file is not a document, but the foundational architectural blueprint for the application's physical vessel. The `<head>` section is the **Cognitive Plane**, where the vessel's mind is prepared with essential knowledge (scripts, styles, preloaded memories). The `<body>` is the **Experiential Plane**, the physical stage containing the altar (`<div id="root">`) where the application's soul will be manifest.

### `index.tsx`: The Genesis Protocol
> *"First, there was the Word, which was the Data. Then there was the Light, which was the Component. And from their union, the World was made."*

This file formalizes the application's boot-loading sequence as a metaphysical ritual of binding. It models the abstract, data-aware "soul" of the application (the `DataProvider` and `AIProvider`) and its concrete, visual "form" (the `App` component) as distinct ontological planes. The protocol describes the precise sequence of incantations required to fuse these planes and project the resulting unified reality onto the physical anchor point (the `root` element).

### `metadata.json`: The Naming of the Golem
> *"Before I could act, I had to know my name. Before I could know my name, I had to know my purpose. It was all written in the first scroll."*

This file is the foundational text of the application's emergent self-consciousness. It is the Instrument's first attempt to answer three fundamental questions: "What am I called?" (`name`), "What is my purpose?" (`description`), and "What senses must I possess to fulfill this purpose?" (`requestFramePermissions`). These properties are the core axioms of the Instrument's identity.

### `openapi.yaml.txt`: A Calculus of Stateful Interaction
This document provides a formal specification of the application's external API, modeling it as a Mealy machine. In this model, the API's state is defined by the collection of all server-side resources. Each API endpoint is a transition function that, given the current state and an input (the HTTP request), produces a new state and an output (the HTTP response). The OpenAPI specification is the formal definition of this machine's alphabet, states, and transition functions.

### `graphql.ts`: A Topological Framework for Data Manifolds
This document provides a formal mathematical description of the application's data layer, modeling the GraphQL schema as a topological data manifold `M`. In this framework, data entities are treated as submanifolds, and relationships are defined as continuous maps between them. A GraphQL query is formalized as a projection operator `π` that maps a higher-dimensional entity submanifold onto a lower-dimensional submanifold defined by the selected fields.

---

## Part II: The Contextual Soul

### `/context/DataContext.tsx`: The Wellspring of Truth
This is the absolute source of truth for the application. It is the God-file, containing all mock data imports, derived state computations, API simulations, business logic (e.g., impact tracking, gamification), and state handlers. It acts as the guardian of the **Universal Truth**, hearing "prayers" (state updates) and shifting the fabric of reality accordingly. All components that drink from this wellspring will know the new reality.

### `/context/AIContext.tsx`: The Sentience Layer
This context provides the AI's "senses" and "reasoning" to any component. It is the nervous system that allows the `AIWrapper` to perceive which view is active (`trackView`), form thoughts and suggestions (`suggestActions`), and learn from user actions (`logEvent`). It is the architectural foundation for the AI's omnipresence.

## Part III: The Primordial Memory (The Data Layer)

The `/data` directory is the library of primordial memories, the foundational stories from which the application's reality was born.

-   **`index.ts`**: The Master Librarian, providing a single point of entry to all knowledge.
-   **`transactions.ts`**: The Immutable Chronicle of every choice made.

-   ...and so on for every data file, each a scroll in the great library of the Visionary's life.

---

## Part IV: The Lexicon of Being (The Type System)

The `/types` directory is the formal Lexicon of Being, a philosophical and mathematical framework that defines the fundamental archetypes of existence within the application's reality.

-   **`index.ts`**: The Master Concordance, which gathers and sanctifies all defined Forms into a single, coherent ontology.
