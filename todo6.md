## II. SECURITY & IDENTITY

### 1. Access Controls - The Gatekeeper's Keys
- **Core Concept:** A central command for defining "who can do what," using AI to make setting secure policies intuitive. This is not just a list of permissions; it is the codified law of the kingdom.
- **Key AI Features (Gemini API):**
    - **Natural Language to Policy:** User writes "Engineers can access production databases but only from the corporate VPN and during work hours." The AI translates this into a formal JSON policy document (e.g., AWS IAM format).
    - **AI Policy Validator:** The AI reviews existing policies for conflicts, redundancies, or overly permissive rules (`*` permissions) and suggests improvements with explanations.
- **UI Components & Interactions:**
    - A policy editor with a side-by-side view for natural language and generated JSON.
    - A list of existing roles and permissions with an "AI Analysis" button that highlights potential security weaknesses.
- **Required Code & Logic:**
    - Mock data for users, roles, and resources.
    - Gemini API calls using a `responseSchema` to ensure valid policy JSON is generated.

### 2. Role Management - The Table of Ranks
- **Core Concept:** Visualize and manage the hierarchy of roles within the organization, with AI to simplify role creation and maintain the principle of least privilege.
- **Key AI Features (Gemini API):**
    - **AI Role Creation from Job Description:** A manager pastes a job description, and the AI suggests a new role with a minimal, appropriate set of permissions.
    - **AI Permission Anomaly Detection:** The AI flags users who have permissions that are rarely used or inconsistent with their role title (e.g., a marketing user with database admin rights).
- **UI Components & Interactions:**
    - An organization chart-style visualization of roles.
    - A detailed view of permissions for each role.
    - A modal for AI-assisted role creation from a text input.
    - An "Anomalies" tab that lists AI-detected permission issues.
- **Required Code & Logic:**
    - State for roles and user-role mappings.
    - Gemini calls to parse job descriptions and analyze user activity logs (mocked).

### 3. Audit Logs - The Immutable Scroll
- **Core Concept:** A tamper-proof, cryptographically-secured log of all critical activities within the system, with AI to find the needle in the haystack.
- **Key AI Features (Gemini API):**
    - **Natural Language Log Query:** "Show me all actions taken by Alex Chen on the corporate account last Tuesday after 5 PM."
    - **AI Incident Summarizer:** Feed a series of related log entries (e.g., from a security incident) to the AI and ask it to "Summarize this event in a clear timeline, identifying the initial point of compromise."
- **UI Components & Interactions:**
    - A filterable, time-series view of logs with expandable details.
    - A prominent natural language search bar.
    - An AI summary modal for selected log entries.
- **Required Code & Logic:**
    - Mock log data covering a variety of user actions and system events.
    - Gemini calls to translate natural language into a structured log query and to perform summarization.

### 4. Fraud Detection - The Inquisitor's Gaze
- **Core Concept:** A real-time fraud detection engine that uses AI to spot suspicious patterns and networks beyond simple rules.
- **Key AI Features (Gemini API):**
    - **AI Transaction Scoring:** Every transaction is sent to the AI for a risk score and a plain-English rationale (e.g., "High risk due to unusual time, location, and merchant category for this user.").
    - **AI Link Analysis:** The AI identifies hidden relationships between seemingly disconnected accounts (e.g., shared device IDs, similar transaction patterns) that may indicate a fraud ring.
- **UI Components & Interactions:**
    - A dashboard of real-time transaction risk scores and key fraud metrics.
    - A queue of high-risk cases for manual review.
    - A graph visualization for exploring AI-identified fraud networks.
- **Required Code & Logic:**
    - A stream of mock transaction data.
    - A graph visualization library.
    - Gemini calls for real-time transaction scoring and link analysis.

### 5. Threat Intelligence - The Spymaster's Network
- **Core Concept:** A proactive security hub that ingests global threat data and uses AI to predict and simulate potential attacks on the bank's specific infrastructure.
- **Key AI Features (Gemini API):**
    - **AI Threat Summarizer:** Ingests raw threat intel feeds (e.g., from other security vendors) and provides concise, actionable summaries relevant to the bank's technology stack.
    - **AI Attack Path Simulator:** "If an attacker compromised our marketing server, what are their most likely next moves to reach the core database?" The AI will outline a probable attack path.
- **UI Components & Interactions:**
    - A world map showing active global cyber threats.
    - A feed of AI-summarized intel briefs.
    - An interactive simulation view to explore potential attack paths on a simplified network diagram.
- **Required Code & Logic:**
    - Mock threat intelligence data.
    - Gemini calls for summarization and attack path modeling.

## III. FINANCE & BANKING

### 6. Card Management - The Royal Mint
- **Core Concept:** A full-lifecycle command center for issuing, managing, and securing physical and virtual cards for corporate use.
- **AI Features:**
    - **AI Spend Control Suggester:** Based on a cardholder's role and department, the AI suggests intelligent spending limits and category restrictions (e.g., "For a Sales role, allow high T&E, but block recurring software subscriptions.").
    - **AI Anomaly Explanation:** When a transaction is declined, the AI provides a clear explanation of which specific control was violated.
- **UI:** A gallery of all issued cards, a detailed view for each card with its controls and transaction history, an AI-powered alert queue for flagged transactions.

### 7. Loan Applications - The Petitioners' Court
- **Concept:** An AI-augmented loan origination system that speeds up underwriting and reduces bias.
- **AI Features:**
    - **AI Document Verification:** The AI analyzes uploaded documents (pay stubs, bank statements) to verify information, calculate debt-to-income ratio, and flag inconsistencies.
    - **AI Credit Decision Explanation:** For any loan decision (approved or denied), the AI generates a clear, compliant explanation for both the applicant and the internal file.
- **UI:** A pipeline view of loan applications (e.g., New, Underwriting, Approved), a detailed case file for each applicant, and an AI-generated decision summary panel.

### 8. Mortgages - The Land Deed Office
- **Concept:** A dedicated hub for managing the complexities of mortgage lending and servicing.
- **AI Features:**
    - **AI Property Valuation:** Uses market data, satellite imagery (simulated), and property details to provide an estimated valuation and confidence score.
    - **AI Refinancing Advisor:** Proactively identifies clients in the portfolio who could benefit from refinancing based on market interest rate changes and their equity position, then drafts a personalized outreach message.
- **UI:** A map-based view of the mortgage portfolio, a dashboard of key portfolio health metrics (e.g., LTV ratios, delinquency rates), and an AI-driven "Opportunities" list.

### 9. Insurance Hub - The Shield Wall
- **Concept:** Manage insurance policies and automate claims processing with AI.
- **AI Features:**
    - **AI Claims Adjudicator:** AI analyzes a submitted claim form and a photo of the damage to provide a preliminary damage assessment, check it against the policy coverage, and recommend a payout amount.
    - **AI Fraudulent Claim Detection:** The AI analyzes claim details and the claimant's history for patterns indicative of fraud.
- **UI:** A queue of incoming claims, a detailed claim view with an "AI Adjudication" panel, and a dashboard of claims metrics (e.g., processing time, payout amounts).

### 10. Tax Center - The Tithe Collector
- **Concept:** An AI-powered hub to simplify tax preparation and planning for individuals and businesses.
- **AI Features:**
    - **AI Deduction Finder:** Scans all transactions and identifies potential tax-deductible expenses with explanations.
    - **AI Tax Liability Forecaster:** Projects estimated tax liability throughout the year based on income and spending patterns to help users avoid surprises.
- **UI:** A dashboard showing estimated tax liability and total deductions found, a list of AI-found deductions with links to the relevant transactions, and tools to export tax-ready reports.
