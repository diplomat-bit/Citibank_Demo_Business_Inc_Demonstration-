# SkyLane: 4D Urban Air Mobility Trajectory Management System

## Overview
SkyLane is an autonomous, decentralized flight management system designed specifically for the complex aerodynamics and spatial constraints of "urban canyons." It moves beyond traditional Air Traffic Control (ATC) by implementing a 4D trajectory negotiation protocol (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Time) to ensure zero-collision throughput for high-density eVTOL (electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing) fleets.

## The Problem
Current airspace management relies on wide separation standards and human controllers, which limits capacity. In dense urban environments, skyscrapers create signal shadows for GPS and turbulent wind tunnels. Traditional pathfinding (A*) is insufficient for dynamic obstacles and the massive scale of autonomous flying taxis, where millisecond latency can lead to catastrophe.

## The Innovation
The core of SkyLane is the **Dynamic Probabilistic Spacetime Tube (DPST)** algorithm. Instead of plotting a thin line for a flight path, the system calculates a volumetric tube that represents the aircraft's position through time, accounting for mechanical variance and environmental factors.

### Key Features

1.  **Decentralized Ledger Negotiation**:
    *   eVTOLs do not wait for a central server to approve every micro-correction. Instead, vehicles utilize V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) communication to "bid" for spacetime voxels.
    *   Conflict resolution is handled via a lightweight consensus algorithm, allowing two converging taxis to automatically adjust speeds so one passes behind the other with optimal spacing.

2.  **Urban Canyon Navigation (Visual-Inertial SLAM)**:
    *   To combat GPS multipath errors caused by glass building reflections, SkyLane uses onboard semantic segmentation.
    *   It recognizes building facades and urban landmarks to lock the vehicle's position within centimeters relative to the city geometry, independent of satellite signals.

3.  **Micro-Weather Venturi Compensation**:
    *   Wind creates dangerous accelerations between tall buildings (the Venturi effect).
    *   SkyLane aggregates data from rooftop anemometers and other aircraft to create a live "turbulence map." Flight controllers pre-actuate stabilizers before entering high-wind zones, ensuring passenger comfort and stability.

4.  **Emergency Swarm Dispersal**:
    *   In the event of a mechanical failure or rogue drone intrusion, the system triggers a localized "repulsion field." Nearby aircraft immediately calculate divergent escape vectors that do not intersect with building surfaces or ground traffic.

## Technical Specifications

*   **Algorithm**: RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) modified for 4D kinematic constraints.
*   **Communication**: 60 GHz mmWave mesh networking for low-latency local coordination.
*   **Compute**: Onboard NVIDIA Orin modules processing sensor fusion; Edge computing nodes on landing pads for regional flow optimization.
*   **Safety Standard**: ISO 26262 ASIL D compliant for autonomous flight logic.

## Societal Impact
SkyLane makes the "flying car" future viable by solving the density problem. It allows thousands of aircraft to operate safely over a city simultaneously, reducing cross-town commutes from 90 minutes on the ground to 12 minutes in the air, unlocking a new dimension of urban mobility without clogging the skyline with noise or accidents.
