# Swarm Search and Rescue Protocol (SSRP)

**Objective:** To enable autonomous drone swarms to effectively map disaster zones, identify survivors, and report findings without relying on GPS or centralized control.

## Core Principles

*   **Decentralization:** No single point of failure. Drones communicate and coordinate peer-to-peer.
*   **Self-Organization:** Drones adapt to changing environments and swarm dynamics.
*   **Local Perception, Global Action:** Drones use local sensors and communication to contribute to a shared understanding of the environment.
*   **Robustness:** Designed to function in GPS-denied, noisy, and dynamic environments.

## System Architecture

1.  **Drone Node:** Each drone in the swarm acts as an independent node with the following capabilities:
    *   **Sensing:**
        *   **Vision (RGB/Thermal):** For environmental mapping and survivor detection.
        *   **Lidar/Depth Sensors:** For local obstacle avoidance and high-resolution 3D mapping.
        *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** For state estimation and relative positioning.
        *   **Barometer/Altimeter:** For altitude estimation.
        *   **Audio Sensors (Optional):** For detecting cries for help.
    *   **Onboard Processing:**
        *   **State Estimation:** Fusing IMU, altitude, and relative positioning data to estimate drone pose.
        *   **Local Mapping:** Creating a 3D point cloud or occupancy grid of the immediate surroundings.
        *   **Object Detection/Recognition:** Identifying potential survivors, hazards, and landmarks.
        *   **Communication Management:** Handling peer-to-peer message routing and swarm coordination logic.
    *   **Communication:**
        *   **Short-Range Radio (e.g., LoRa, UWB):** For inter-drone communication.
        *   **Mesh Networking:** Drones form a dynamic communication mesh to relay information.

2.  **Swarm Coordination Module (Distributed):** Each drone runs a copy of this module. It's responsible for:
    *   **Relative Localization:** Estimating the position and orientation of nearby drones using UWB (if available) or visual odometry cues.
    *   **Shared Map Building (Augmented Reality Mapping):**
        *   **Local Map Merging:** Drones share their local 3D maps and integrate them into a growing global map.
        *   **Feature Matching:** Using visual features to align and fuse overlapping map segments.
        *   **Map Reconciliation:** Algorithms to handle discrepancies and inconsistencies in shared map data.
    *   **Exploration Strategy:**
        *   **Frontier-Based Exploration:** Identifying unexplored areas in the shared map and assigning drones to explore them.
        *   **Information Gain Maximization:** Prioritizing exploration of areas with the highest potential for new information (e.g., areas likely to contain survivors).
        *   **Task Allocation:** Dynamically assigning tasks (exploration, survivor investigation, communication relay) to drones based on their capabilities and current state.
    *   **Survivor Detection and Reporting:**
        *   **Consensus Mechanism:** Multiple drones detecting a potential survivor trigger a confirmation process.
        *   **Survivor Tagging:** Once confirmed, survivors are marked on the shared map with confidence scores and details.
    *   **Communication Routing:** Ensuring messages reach their intended recipients even in a dynamic mesh network.

## Key Algorithms and Techniques

*   **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):**
    *   **Visual SLAM (e.g., ORB-SLAM, VINS-Mono):** For estimating drone pose and building dense environmental maps.
    *   **LiDAR SLAM:** For more accurate and dense 3D reconstructions, especially in feature-poor environments.
    *   **Multi-drone SLAM:** Techniques for fusing maps from multiple sensors and viewpoints.

*   **Relative Pose Estimation:**
    *   **UWB Ranging:** For precise short-range distance measurements between drones.
    *   **Visual Odometry with Inter-Drone Features:** Leveraging visual correspondences between drones to estimate their relative motion.

*   **Mesh Networking Protocols:**
    *   **Custom or adapted protocols:** Optimized for low bandwidth, intermittent connectivity, and dynamic topology.
    *   **Epidemic Routing (Gossip Protocols):** For efficient dissemination of information across the swarm.

*   **Decentralized Task Allocation:**
    *   **Auction-based mechanisms:** Drones bid on exploration frontiers or tasks.
    *   **Market-based approaches:** Drones trade tasks based on their perceived utility.

*   **Consensus Algorithms:**
    *   **Simplified Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) variants:** For agreeing on critical information like survivor locations.

## Operational Workflow

1.  **Deployment:** Swarm is deployed in the vicinity of the disaster zone.
2.  **Initialization:** Drones establish initial relative positions and begin forming a communication mesh.
3.  **Exploration:** Drones autonomously explore the area, building a shared 3D map.
4.  **Survivor Detection:** Drones scan for signs of life using visual, thermal, or audio sensors.
5.  **Confirmation and Reporting:** Detected potential survivors are corroborated by multiple drones and marked on the shared map.
6.  **Hazard Identification:** Dangerous structures or obstacles are identified and logged.
7.  **Dynamic Re-tasking:** As the environment changes or new information emerges, drones adapt their exploration and search strategies.
8.  **Data Aggregation:** At designated times or upon mission completion, the aggregated map data and survivor locations are transmitted to a ground station.

## Advantages

*   **GPS Independence:** Operates in environments where GPS signals are unavailable or unreliable.
*   **Resilience:** Decentralized nature makes it robust to individual drone failures.
*   **Scalability:** Can be deployed with varying numbers of drones.
*   **Adaptability:** Can adjust to dynamic disaster scenarios.
*   **Efficient Mapping:** Rapidly creates a comprehensive map of the disaster area.

## Challenges and Future Work

*   **Scalability of Communication:** Managing communication overhead with very large swarms.
*   **Map Convergence and Consistency:** Ensuring the shared map remains accurate and consistent across all drones, especially in complex environments.
*   **Energy Management:** Optimizing flight paths and tasks to maximize swarm endurance.
*   **Advanced Survivor Detection:** Integrating AI for more accurate and less ambiguous survivor identification.
*   **Human-Drone Teaming:** Protocols for seamless handover of information and tasks to human rescue teams.
*   **Real-time Hazard Assessment:** More sophisticated algorithms for identifying and communicating structural integrity risks.
