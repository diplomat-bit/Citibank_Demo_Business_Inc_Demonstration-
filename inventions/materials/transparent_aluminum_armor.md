# Transparent Aluminum Armor: Crystalline Aluminum Oxynitride (ALON)

## 1. Abstract

This document outlines the proprietary manufacturing process for advanced Crystalline Aluminum Oxynitride (ALON), a polycrystalline ceramic with optical and mechanical properties that rival sapphire at a fraction of the production cost. The resulting material, trademarked as 'Aegis Glass', possesses the hardness and durability of advanced steel armor while maintaining over 95% transparency in the visible and near-infrared spectrums. This process enables the large-scale production of complex, near-net-shape components for aerospace, defense, and high-performance commercial applications.

## 4. Manufacturing Process

The production of Aegis Glass is a multi-stage ceramic engineering process requiring precise control over temperature, pressure, and atmospheric conditions.

### Step 1: Powder Synthesis via Carbothermal Nitridation

The foundational ALON powder is synthesized in a controlled-atmosphere furnace.

1.  **Precursor Mixing:** High-purity aluminum powder is intimately mixed with yttria (0.25% by weight) in a planetary ball mill under an inert argon atmosphere to prevent premature oxidation.
2.  **Reaction:** The mixed powder is loaded into graphite crucibles and placed in a high-temperature tube furnace.
3.  **Heating Cycle:**
    *   The furnace is purged with UHP Nitrogen (N₂) gas.
    *   The temperature is ramped to 1800°C.
    *   A controlled flow of Ammonia (NH₃) gas is introduced. The ammonia thermally decomposes, providing a highly reactive nitrogen source that reacts with the aluminum to form aluminum nitride (AlN) intermediates and subsequently ALON.
    *   The reaction is held at 1800-1950°C for 24-48 hours. The precise temperature profile determines the final stoichiometry and crystal phase purity.
    *   The furnace is then cooled under a continuous N₂ flow.

The resulting product is a coarse, off-white ALON powder.

### Step 2: Powder Processing and Green Body Formation

1.  **Milling & Classification:** The synthesized ALON powder is crushed and then milled in an attritor mill with zirconia media to achieve a sub-micron particle size distribution (D50 < 0.8 µm). This is critical for pore elimination in later stages.
2.  **Slurry Preparation:** The milled powder is mixed with the proprietary organic binder system and a solvent (deionized water) to form a stable, low-viscosity slurry.
3.  **Forming:** The slurry is used to form a "green body" (an unsintered, fragile precursor part). The primary method is slip casting into a porous plaster mold, which allows for complex shapes. For simpler geometries like flat plates, cold isostatic pressing (CIP) of the dry powder-binder mix at 300 MPa is employed.

### Step 3: Binder Burnout and Sintering

1.  **Binder Burnout:** The green body is slowly heated to 600°C in a low-oxygen atmosphere. This stage carefully pyrolyzes and removes the organic binder without introducing cracks or defects.
2.  **Sintering:** The part is transferred to a vacuum or controlled-atmosphere furnace.
    *   The furnace is evacuated and backfilled with UHP Nitrogen.
    *   The temperature is ramped to 2050°C and held for 72 hours.
    *   During this process, solid-state diffusion occurs, fusing the ALON particles together, eliminating porosity, and densifying the part to approximately 99.8% of its theoretical density. The resulting part is translucent but not yet fully transparent.

### Step 4: Annealing and Optical Finishing

1.  **Stress-Relief Annealing:** The sintered part undergoes a controlled cooling cycle from 2050°C down to room temperature over 96 hours to minimize internal stresses, preventing delayed fracture and ensuring maximum mechanical strength.
2.  **Grinding:** The annealed part, now near its final hardness, is precisely ground to final dimensions using diamond-impregnated grinding wheels.
3.  **Lapping & Polishing:** The final step to achieve optical clarity.
    *   The surfaces are lapped using a series of progressively finer diamond slurries (from 30 µm down to 1 µm).
    *   A final chemo-mechanical polishing step using a colloidal silica slurry on a soft pad removes the last vestiges of subsurface damage, resulting in a surface roughness of < 1 nm and achieving full transparency.

## 5. Quality Control

*   **X-Ray Diffraction (XRD):** Verifies the correct cubic spinel crystal phase of the synthesized powder and final part.
*   **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM):** Inspects grain size, distribution, and residual porosity after sintering.
*   **Spectrophotometry:** Measures optical transmission from UV to IR to ensure it meets the >95% transparency specification.
*   **Vickers Hardness Test:** Confirms the mechanical hardness of the final polished material.
*   **Ultrasonic C-Scan:** Non-destructively inspects for internal flaws, cracks, or inclusions.
