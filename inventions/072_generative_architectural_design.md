**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Generative Architectural Design from Constraints

**Abstract:**
A system for architectural design is disclosed. A user provides a set of constraints for a building, such as square footage, number of rooms, architectural style, and site parameters. This information is sent to a generative AI model trained on architectural principles. The AI generates a set of architectural assets, including a 2D floor plan, a 3D model, and realistic exterior renderings, that satisfy the user's constraints.

**Detailed Description:**
Similar to the Urban Symphony Planner, but at the building scale. A user inputs constraints. The system prompts a multi-modal AI: `Generate a 3D model and floor plan for a "2000 sq ft, 3-bedroom, modern-style house on a sloping lot."` The AI generates the design files, which are then displayed in a 3D viewer.

**Claims:**
1. A method for architectural design, comprising:
   a. Receiving a set of design constraints for a building.
   b. Transmitting the constraints to a generative AI model.
   c. Receiving a set of generated architectural assets, including a floor plan, from the model.
   d. Displaying the assets to a user.
