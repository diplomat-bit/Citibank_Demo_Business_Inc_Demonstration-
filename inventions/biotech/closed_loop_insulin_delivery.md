# Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery System with Reinforcement Learning and Image Analysis

## Invention Name: AutoDose AI

## Core Concept

The AutoDose AI is a revolutionary, fully automated, closed-loop insulin delivery system designed to manage Type 1 Diabetes with minimal patient intervention. It combines real-time, multi-modal sensor data fusion with an advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to predict glucose fluctuations and dynamically adjust basal and bolus insulin delivery via a smart pump.

## Key Features & Innovations

1.  **Food Image Analysis Module (FIAM):**
    *   A miniature, attachable smartphone/wearable camera continuously captures images of the user's meals before consumption.
    *   A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) analyzes the image, estimating carbohydrate content, fat percentage, and fiber density using advanced segmentation and color analysis calibrated against a vast, crowdsourced food database.
    *   This estimation provides a highly accurate, *pre-prandial* carb count, overcoming the inherent lag and inaccuracy of manual carb counting.

2.  **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion:**
    *   Integrates data streams from a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) (measuring interstitial fluid glucose) and a novel, non-invasive **Ketone/Lactate Sensor Patch**.
    *   The RL agent learns to interpret the combination of these signals (Glucose, Rate of Change (RoC), Ketones, Lactate) to identify impending physiological stress (e.g., illness, rapid anaerobic exercise) that traditional glucose-only systems miss.

3.  **Deep Q-Network (DQN) Control Agent:**
    *   The core decision-making component uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) optimized for time-series control.
    *   **State Space:** Includes FIAM output (estimated carbs, fat), CGM readings (current, trend), sensor patch data, recent activity (from fitness trackers), and time since last meal.
    *   **Action Space:** Discrete and continuous adjustments to basal rate (up/down by 0.01 U/min) and timing/size of micro-boluses (0.05U increments).
    *   **Reward Function:** Heavily penalized for Time In Range (TIR) breaches (both hypo- and hyperglycemia) and high variability (standard deviation of glucose). Rewards are maximized for TIR maintenance and efficient insulin utilization (minimizing total daily dose while maintaining target).

4.  **Personalized Pharmacokinetic (PK) Modeling:**
    *   The RL agent dynamically tunes an underlying, patient-specific insulin absorption model (e.g., based on SC injection site variations, skin temperature, and recent activity levels) rather than relying on a fixed time-action profile. This allows for predictive adjustment of peak insulin effect timing.

## Advantages Over Existing Systems

*   **Proactive Correction:** The FIAM enables bolusing decisions *before* food is fully digested, drastically reducing post-meal spikes compared to reactive algorithms that wait for CGM confirmation.
*   **Stress Immunity:** Incorporation of non-glucose biomarkers allows the system to anticipate and preemptively counteract stress-induced hyperglycemia (e.g., due to infection or high emotional stress) before glucose levels rise significantly.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The RL agent continuously refines its policy based on the patient's specific responses to different food types and activity levels over time, leading to superior long-term control compared to fixed PID controllers or basic model predictive control (MPC).

## Potential Impact

AutoDose AI promises to reduce the cognitive burden of diabetes management to near zero, leading to significantly improved glycemic control, reduced risk of long-term complications, and a quality of life indistinguishable from a non-diabetic individual.
