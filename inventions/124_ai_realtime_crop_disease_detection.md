**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Real-Time Crop Disease Detection from Aerial Imagery

**Abstract:**
A system for precision agriculture is disclosed. The system ingests a real-time video feed from a drone flying over a field of crops. A multi-modal AI model, running on the edge or in the cloud, analyzes the video frames. The model, trained to recognize the visual signs of common crop diseases and pests, identifies and geotags specific areas of the field that show signs of stress or infection. This information is displayed on a map for the farmer, allowing for targeted application of treatments.

**Detailed Description:**
A drone flies over a cornfield. Its video feed is processed by an AI model. The model detects a patch of plants with a specific type of leaf discoloration. It identifies this as a high-probability match for "Northern Corn Leaf Blight" and creates a GPS-tagged alert on the farmer's dashboard, showing the exact location and extent of the potential outbreak.

**Claims:**
1. A method for agricultural monitoring, comprising:
   a. Receiving an image or video feed of a crop field.
   b. Analyzing the imagery with a generative AI model trained to identify visual symptoms of crop diseases.
   c. Identifying and marking the geographic locations of potential infections.
   d. Displaying the marked locations to a user.
