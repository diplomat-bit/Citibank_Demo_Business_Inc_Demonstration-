**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generating Construction-Ready Architectural Blueprints

**Abstract:**
A system for architectural design is disclosed. The system extends beyond simple 3D models by generating a complete set of construction-ready documents from a high-level design prompt. A user provides constraints for a building. The AI generates the architectural design, and then proceeds to generate the associated structural engineering plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing diagrams, ensuring all systems are integrated and compliant with building codes.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
This system uses a chain of specialized AI agents. The first agent designs the building's form (as in invention #072). Its output is then passed to a "Structural AI," which is prompted to design a compliant frame for that form. The output is then passed to an "MEP AI" (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) to design the internal systems. The final output is a complete set of CAD files.

**Claims:**
1. A method for architectural design, comprising:
   a. Generating a primary architectural design from a user's prompt.
   b. Providing the architectural design to a second generative AI model to generate corresponding structural engineering plans.
   c. Aggregating the designs into a complete set of construction documents.
