**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for AI-Powered Geopolitical Risk Forecasting

**Abstract:**
A system for forecasting geopolitical risk is disclosed. The system ingests a high-volume stream of international news, diplomatic cables, economic reports, and social media data. A generative AI model, trained on historical political science and international relations data, analyzes this stream to identify emerging patterns of instability. The AI generates qualitative forecasts for specific regions, assessing the probability of events like civil unrest, trade disputes, or interstate conflict, and provides a rationale based on the data.

**Detailed Description:**
The system continuously monitors news feeds. It detects a spike in articles about naval activity in a contested sea. It prompts an AI: `You are a geopolitical risk analyst. Based on the increased naval patrols and recent diplomatic statements, what is the probability of a maritime trade disruption in this region in the next 30 days?` The AI synthesizes the information and provides a probabilistic forecast and a written analysis.

**Claims:**
1. A method for risk forecasting, comprising:
   a. Ingesting data from a plurality of international news and economic sources.
   b. Providing the data to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a forecast for the probability of a specific geopolitical event occurring in a given region.
   d. Displaying the forecast to a user.
