**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Interior Design

**Abstract:**
A system for interior design visualization is disclosed. A user uploads a photo of a room. They then provide a text prompt describing a desired style (e.g., "mid-century modern with a cozy feel"). The system uses a multi-modal generative AI model to "re-paint" the user's photo, transforming the room to match the described style while preserving its core architectural layout.

**Detailed Description:**
This is a multi-modal editing task. The user's photo and text prompt are sent to a model like Gemini. The prompt is: `Reder an image of this room in a "mid-century modern" style.` The AI understands the objects in the room and replaces them with stylistically appropriate alternatives, returning a new image of the redecorated room.

**Claims:**
1. A method for interior design, comprising:
   a. Receiving an image of a room and a text prompt describing a style.
   b. Transmitting the image and prompt to a multi-modal AI model.
   c. Receiving a new image from the model depicting the room re-styled according to the prompt.
   d. Displaying the new image to the user.
