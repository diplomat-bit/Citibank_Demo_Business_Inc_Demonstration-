**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Tailoring Resumes to Job Descriptions

**Abstract:**
A system for assisting job seekers is disclosed. A user provides their base resume and the text of a job description. The system sends both documents to a generative AI model. The AI is prompted to analyze the job description for key skills and requirements. It then suggests specific edits to the user's resume, such as rephrasing bullet points or highlighting different projects, to better align the resume with the target job without fabricating information.

**Detailed Description:**
A user pastes their resume and a job description into two text fields. The system prompts an LLM: `You are a career coach. Based on the job description, suggest 3-5 specific improvements to the provided resume to make it a stronger match.` The AI's response is a list of suggested edits, which the user can then apply.

**Claims:**
1. A method for resume assistance, comprising:
   a. Receiving a user's resume and a target job description.
   b. Transmitting both documents to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to suggest edits to the resume to better align it with the job description.
   d. Displaying the suggested edits to the user.
