**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Predictive Social and Cultural Trend Analysis

**Abstract:**
A system for predicting social trends is disclosed. The system ingests a massive, real-time stream of public data from social media, news sites, and online forums. A generative AI model is used to perform a time-series analysis on the emergence and velocity of new memes, keywords, and concepts. The system identifies concepts that are accelerating and predicts their likely trajectory, allowing brands and researchers to anticipate cultural trends before they become mainstream.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
The system continuously analyzes a stream of text data. It prompts an LLM to identify novel concepts. For each new concept, it tracks its "mention velocity." **Prompt:** `Based on the rising velocity of the term "AI Pin," and its semantic similarity to the "wearable tech" cluster, predict its potential to become a major consumer trend in the next 6 months.`

**Claims:**
1. A method for trend analysis, comprising:
   a. Ingesting a real-time stream of public text data.
   b. Using an AI model to identify emerging concepts within the data.
   c. Analyzing the rate of change of mentions for said concepts.
   d. Using a generative AI model to generate a forecast of a concept's future popularity.
