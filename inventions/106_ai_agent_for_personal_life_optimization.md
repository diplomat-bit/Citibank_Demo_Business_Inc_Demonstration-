**Title of Invention:** An AI Agent for Holistic Personal Life Optimization

**Abstract:**
An autonomous AI agent for personal productivity and well-being is disclosed. The user grants the agent secure, read-only access to their personal data streams (calendar, email, fitness, finance). The user also defines a set of high-level life priorities. The agent continuously analyzes the user's data in the context of their stated priorities and suggests actions to better align their use of resources (time, money, attention) with their goals.

**Detailed Description:**
An "AI Chief of Staff" acts as a central reasoning layer on top of a user's personal data. For example, seeing a high-stress day on the calendar and a low step count from a fitness tracker, it might send a push notification: `"Your day looks intense. I've found a 30-minute gap at 3 PM. Would you like me to block it out for a walk to help you meet your health goal?"` The system moves from disconnected tools to a single, proactive partner in living an intentional life.

**Claims:**
1. A method for personal optimization, comprising:
   a. Receiving a set of high-level life goals from a user.
   b. An AI agent accessing a plurality of a user's personal data streams.
   c. The agent continuously analyzing the data in the context of the user's goals.
   d. The agent autonomously suggesting or taking actions designed to better align the user's resources with their goals.
