**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Joke Writing and Humor Analysis

**Abstract:**
A system for computational humor is disclosed. A user provides a topic or a premise. The system sends this to a generative AI model, prompted to act as a comedian. The AI generates a joke based on the premise. In a separate function, the AI can receive a joke and be prompted to explain the comedic structure and the reason it is funny (e.g., by identifying the setup, punchline, and the subversion of expectation).

**Detailed Description:**
A user prompts the AI: "Write a joke about programming." The AI responds: "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs." The user can then ask the AI to "Explain why that joke is funny," and the AI would respond by explaining the double meaning of the word "bugs."

**Claims:**
1. A method for generating humor, comprising:
   a. Receiving a topic from a user.
   b. Prompting a generative AI model to create a joke related to the topic.
   c. Presenting the joke to the user.

2. The method of claim 1, further comprising:
   a. Prompting the model to provide a deconstruction of the joke's comedic structure.
