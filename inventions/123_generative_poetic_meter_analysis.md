**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Analysis of Poetic Meter

**Abstract:**
A system for literary analysis is disclosed. A user provides a piece of text, such as a poem or a line of verse. The system sends the text to a generative AI model trained on phonetics and poetry. The AI analyzes the text to determine its metrical pattern (e.g., iambic pentameter), marking the stressed and unstressed syllables. The AI then provides a plain-English explanation of the meter and its effect on the poem's rhythm and tone.

**Detailed Description:**
A student pastes a line from Shakespeare into the tool: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" The system prompts an AI: `Perform a scansion of the following line of poetry. Mark the stressed (/) and unstressed (x) syllables and identify the meter.` The AI returns: `x / x / x / x / x /` and identifies it as "Iambic Pentameter."

**Claims:**
1. A method for literary analysis, comprising:
   a. Receiving a piece of text from a user.
   b. Providing the text to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to analyze the text's metrical structure and identify the poetic meter.
   d. Displaying the analysis to the user.
