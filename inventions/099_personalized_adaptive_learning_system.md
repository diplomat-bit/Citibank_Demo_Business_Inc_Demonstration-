**Title of Invention:** A Personalized and Adaptive Learning System

**Abstract:**
A system for education is disclosed. The system generates a personalized curriculum for a student based on their goals. As the student progresses, they take quizzes and complete exercises. The system analyzes their performance to identify specific areas of weakness. A generative AI model is then used to dynamically create new, targeted learning materials—such as practice problems, simplified explanations, or analogies—that are specifically designed to address the student's individual learning gaps.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
A student is learning algebra and struggles with "factoring polynomials." The system detects this via a quiz. It prompts an LLM: `The student is struggling with factoring polynomials. Generate three new practice problems with step-by-step solutions, and create a simple analogy to explain the concept.` This custom-generated content is then immediately presented to the student.

**Claims:**
1. A method for personalized education, comprising:
   a. Assessing a student's performance to identify a specific area of weakness.
   b. Using a generative AI model to create new learning materials tailored to address the identified weakness.
   c. Presenting the new materials to the student.
