**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Scent Composition

**Abstract:**
A system for designing novel scents for perfumery is disclosed. A user provides a natural language prompt describing a desired mood or theme (e.g., "a scent that evokes a library with old books and leather chairs"). The system uses a generative AI model trained on a large database of chemical aroma compounds and their perceptual descriptors. The AI generates one or more novel formulas, specifying a combination of chemical compounds and their precise ratios, designed to produce the desired scent.

**Detailed Description:**
A perfumer prompts the AI: "Design a fresh, oceanic scent with notes of citrus and salt." The AI, knowing which aroma molecules correspond to these concepts, generates a formula: `Limonene: 15%, Calone: 10%, Ambroxan: 5%, Hedione: 20%...` This formula provides a starting point for the perfumer to physically mix and refine the new scent.

**Claims:**
1. A method for scent design, comprising:
   a. Receiving a natural language description of a desired scent.
   b. Providing the description to a generative AI model trained on the properties of aroma compounds.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a formula, comprising a list of compounds and their ratios, to create the desired scent.
   d. Presenting the formula to the user.
