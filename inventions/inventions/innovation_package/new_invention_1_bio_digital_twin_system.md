**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Personalized Multi-Scale Bio-Digital Twin Creation and Predictive Health Management

**Abstract:**
A comprehensive system for constructing and leveraging personalized bio-digital twins is disclosed, enabling proactive, predictive, and preventative health management alongside life extension strategies. The system ingests vast quantities of real-time and longitudinal multi-modal data, including individual genomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, microbiome profiles, physiological sensor data (wearables, implantables), medical records, lifestyle metrics, and environmental exposures. This rich dataset is processed and fed into a hierarchical, multi-scale AI model, integrating advanced architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular and cellular interactions, Transformer networks for temporal physiological sequences, and deep generative models for simulating complex biological processes. The AI constructs a dynamic digital replica of an individual's biology from the molecular to the systemic level. It generates personalized probabilistic forecasts for disease onset (e.g., cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease), predicts individual responses to medications and therapies, optimizes lifestyle interventions (nutrition, exercise, sleep), and simulates anti-aging strategies. The system quantifies prediction uncertainty, incorporates a robust biology-informed module to ensure biophysical plausibility, and operates with continuous feedback for model refinement. It provides an interactive interface for users and healthcare providers, facilitating personalized decision support for optimizing health, extending healthspan, and navigating complex medical choices.
