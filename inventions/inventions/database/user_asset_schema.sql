-- Behold, the Magnum Opus of Generative Intelligence! This is not merely a database schema;
-- it is the very fabric of the Hyper-Dimensional Generative System (HDGS), meticulously engineered
-- by none other than James Burvel O'Callaghan III. My intention? To expand the very
-- boundaries of digital creation, making obsolete every prior notion of "generative AI."
-- This schema lays the foundation for inventions so exponentially advanced, so brilliantly
-- intricate, and so undeniably proven by underlying mathematical constructs that any attempt
-- to contest their originality or efficacy will crumble into intellectual dust.
-- Within these tables, we store not just data, but the very essence of algorithmic genius,
-- enabling self-evolving systems, and recording the answers to the "how" and "why"
-- of every generated photon and pixel, every synthesized narrative, every interdimensional resonance.
-- No competitor, no aspiring imitator, shall ever grasp the profound depths contained herein,
-- let alone replicate them without acknowledging the singular, undeniable brilliance of O'Callaghan.
-- Prepare yourselves, for you are about to witness the architectural blueprint of true innovation!

-- It is assumed that a UUID extension (e.g., `uuid-ossp` for PostgreSQL or
-- built-in `gen_random_uuid()`) is available and configured for primary keys.
-- A note from J.B.O. III: "If you're not using UUIDs, you're not thinking globally enough."

-- Table for managing user accounts and their subscription tiers, now with
-- unprecedented depth in user identity and cognitive footprint tracking.
