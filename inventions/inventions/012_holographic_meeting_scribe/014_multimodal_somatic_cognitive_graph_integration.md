**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Multimodal Somatic-Cognitive Graph Integration and Semantic Fusion of Discursive Knowledge with Real-time Human Physiological and Behavioral Data for Embodied Affective and Cognitive State Reconstruction in Dynamic Social Contexts

**Abstract:**
This invention presents a paradigm-shifting system and associated methodologies for transcending the limitations of purely linguistic discourse analysis by incorporating real-time, multi-modal human physiological and behavioral data. Building upon advanced knowledge graph generation from temporal linguistic artifacts, the system introduces a sophisticated Multimodal Fusion Graph Core. This core semantically integrates and fuses the linguistic knowledge graph with data streams derived from biometric sensors (e.g., EEG, ECG, EDA, eye-tracking) and behavioral analytics (e.g., facial expressions, prosody, gaze patterns). Leveraging specialized deep learning models and contextual AI, the system rigorously extracts and annotates affective states, cognitive loads, engagement levels, and inter-personal dynamics from these physiological and behavioral signals. The culmination is an Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph ESCKG, a richly attributed, multi-dimensional representation where linguistic concepts, decisions, and actions are explicitly linked to the embodied cognitive and emotional states of participants during discourse. This ESCKG is then rendered as an enhanced, interactive 3D volumetric visualization, offering an unprecedented, holistic, and spatially augmented understanding of not just *what* was said, but *how* it was felt, perceived, and cognitively processed, thereby enabling profound insights into collaborative efficacy, emotional resonance, and decision-making integrity in dynamic social contexts.

**Background of the Invention:**
The preceding invention, "A System and Method for Semantic-Topological Reconstruction and Volumetric Visualization of Discursive Knowledge Graphs from Temporal Linguistic Artifacts," significantly advanced the comprehension of human discourse by transforming linear text into navigable 3D knowledge graphs. However, human communication is intrinsically multi-modal and deeply embodied. Purely linguistic analysis, no matter how sophisticated, inherently provides an incomplete understanding, as it overlooks the profound influence of non-verbal cues, physiological responses, and implicit behavioral signals that convey sentiment, cognitive effort, engagement, deception, or agreement. Traditional methods of analyzing meetings or collaborative sessions typically rely solely on transcribed words, missing critical layers of information such as:
1.  **Affective Dynamics:** The emotional states of participants, their shifts, and how they propagate.
2.  **Cognitive Load:** The mental effort expended, moments of confusion, understanding, or focused attention.
3.  **Engagement Levels:** Whether participants are actively attentive or disengaged.
4.  **Interpersonal Synchrony:** The subtle mirroring or divergence in physiological responses that indicate rapport or tension.
Existing fragmented solutions might detect emotion from text or infer stress from heart rate variability in isolation. However, a critical exigency remains for a comprehensive, integrated system capable of: (a) acquiring heterogeneous real-time physiological and behavioral data; (b) robustly extracting meaningful affective and cognitive features; and (c) semantically fusing these embodied insights with the structured linguistic knowledge graph to produce a holistic, multi-dimensional model of discourse that is both rich in content and profound in context. Without such integration, the true, embodied fabric of human interaction remains largely uncaptured, leading to suboptimal insights into team dynamics, decision quality, and overall communication effectiveness.

**Brief Summary of the Invention:**
The present invention pioneers a revolutionary integration framework that elevates discourse analysis to an embodied, somatic-cognitive level. At its core, the system ingests the structured linguistic knowledge graph generated by an advanced AI processing core (as described in our previous invention) and simultaneously acquires multi-modal physiological and behavioral data streams from meeting participants. These real-time streams, encompassing data from wearables (e.g., EEG, ECG, EDA), cameras (e.g., facial expressions, gaze), and microphones (e.g., prosody), are channeled through a dedicated Physiological and Behavioral Feature Extraction Core. This core applies state-of-the-art signal processing, computer vision, and machine listening techniques to robustly identify and quantify an array of somatic markers, including heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, brainwave patterns indicative of cognitive load or attention, micro-facial expressions, gaze direction, and vocal emotional prosody. Subsequently, a novel Multimodal Fusion Graph Core performs a precise temporal alignment and semantic fusion. This fusion dynamically augments the linguistic knowledge graph with new nodes representing inferred affective and cognitive states (e.g., "High Stress", "Focused Attention", "Agreement"), and new edges quantifying their influence on, or correlation with, linguistic entities, decisions, or other participants' states. The output is an Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph ESCKG, a unified, richly attributed graph offering a holistic representation of the meeting's intellectual and emotional landscape. This ESCKG is then presented via an enhanced 3D volumetric rendering engine, which dynamically visualizes these embodied dimensions through sophisticated visual encodings such as real-time node animations, aura effects, dynamic environmental cues, and participant-specific somatic overlays, enabling users to intuitively navigate and comprehend the multi-layered cognitive and affective substratum of human discourse.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**

The present invention meticulously details a comprehensive system and methodology for the integration and semantic fusion of linguistic knowledge graphs with real-time, multi-modal human physiological and behavioral data, culminating in an Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph ESCKG and its immersive visualization.

**Mathematical Representation of System Interactions:**

Let `L(t)` be the linguistic input stream at time `t`, and `Phi(t)` be the raw multimodal physiological and behavioral data stream at time `t`.

1.  **Linguistic Knowledge Graph Generation:**
    The AI Semantic Processing Core `A_Core` transforms `L(t)` into linguistic events `E_L(t)` and relations `R_L(t)`, which are then structured into a Linguistic Knowledge Graph `Gamma_L(t)`.
    `Gamma_L(t) = A_Core(L(t))`
    `Gamma_L(t) = (N_L(t), E_L(t))` where `N_L(t)` are linguistic nodes and `E_L(t)` are linguistic edges.

2.  **Multimodal Somatic Data Pipeline:**
    The Multimodal Sensor Ingestion Module `S_Ingest` acquires and preprocesses `Phi(t)`.
    `Phi_processed(t) = S_Ingest(Phi(t))`
    The Physiological Behavioral Feature Extraction Core `S_Extract` extracts features `Z(t)` for each participant `p`.
    `Z_p(t) = S_Extract(Phi_processed_p(t))`
    These features are then aggregated and synchronized into `Z_synch(t)` by `SYNCH_BUFFER`.

3.  **Multimodal Fusion Graph Core:**
    The `FUSION_CORE` integrates `Gamma_L(t)` and `Z_synch(t)` to produce the Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph `Gamma_ESCKG(t)`.
    `Gamma_ESCKG(t) = FUSION_CORE(Gamma_L(t), Z_synch(t))`
    `Gamma_ESCKG(t) = (N_ESCKG(t), E_ESCKG(t))` where `N_ESCKG(t)` and `E_ESCKG(t)` include linguistic, somatic, and cross-modal elements.

4.  **Enhanced 3D Volumetric Rendering:**
    The `E_REND` maps `Gamma_ESCKG(t)` to a visual representation `V(t)`.
    `V(t) = E_REND(Gamma_ESCKG(t))`

### 2. Multimodal Sensor Ingestion Module

```

*   **2.1. Signal Acquisition Subsystem (SAQ):**
    *   **Wearable Sensors:** Integrates with medical-grade or research-grade EEG (electroencephalography), ECG (electrocardiography), EDA (electrodermal activity, also known as GSR galvanic skin response), and eye-tracking devices. Captures raw physiological signals at high sampling rates (e.g., EEG at 250-1000 Hz, ECG at 500-1000 Hz, EDA at 4-100 Hz). Additional optional sensors include Electromyography (EMG) for muscle activity, capturing micro-gestures and tension at 1000-2000 Hz.
    *   **Computer Vision Sensors:** Utilizes high-resolution cameras (e.g., 30-60 FPS) to capture participant facial expressions, head pose, gaze direction, posture, gestures, and overall body language. Employing privacy-preserving techniques like skeletal tracking and facial landmark detection instead of raw video storage. This involves `N_P` cameras for `N_P` participants.
    *   **Acoustic Sensors:** Employs directional microphones (e.g., 44.1 kHz sampling rate) for capturing individual speech, allowing for detailed prosodic analysis (pitch, intensity, speaking rate, voice quality) independent of lexical content.
    *   **Environmental Context Sensors:** Optional sensors to capture ambient conditions such as temperature, lighting, and noise levels, which can influence cognitive and affective states (e.g., ambient light sensors, thermometers, sound level meters).
    *   **Haptic Interaction Devices:** For scenarios involving physical interaction, haptic devices can provide data on touch pressure, force, and interaction patterns (e.g., stylus pressure, VR controller haptics).

*   **2.2. Noise Filtering and Artifact Removal (NOISE_FILT):**
    *   Applies advanced signal processing algorithms, e.g., independent component analysis (ICA) for EEG, wavelet denoising for ECG, adaptive Kalman filters for sensor fusion, to remove noise and motion artifacts inherent in real-time physiological data.
    *   For an input signal `X(t)`, the denoised signal `X_filtered(t)` is given by:
        `X_filtered(t) = Denoise(X(t), H)` where `H` is a set of filter parameters or learned artifact models.
    *   For EEG, this includes power line noise removal, eye blink artifact rejection, and muscle artifact suppression.
        `EEG_clean(t) = ICA(EEG_raw(t)) - BlinkArtifacts - MuscleArtifacts`
    *   For ECG, baseline wander removal and motion artifact suppression using adaptive filters.
        `ECG_clean(t) = ButterworthFilter(ECG_raw(t), f_low, f_high) - BaselineCorrection`
    *   For camera data, robust background subtraction and motion compensation.
        `Frame_stabilized(t) = Stabilize(Frame_raw(t))`

*   **2.3. Temporal Synchronization Module (TIME_SYNC):**
    *   Critically ensures that all incoming multi-modal data streams are precisely synchronized to a common timestamp, essential for accurate fusion with linguistic data. Utilizes synchronized clock signals or post-hoc alignment algorithms, e.g., cross-correlation of shared event markers.
    *   Let `S_k(t_k)` be the raw data from sensor `k` sampled at its own timestamp `t_k`. The goal is to obtain `S'_k(T)` for a common time base `T`.
    *   `T_global = max_k(T_start_k)` (global start time)
    *   `S'_k(T) = Interpolate(S_k(t_k), T)`
    *   Synchronization error `E_sync = sum_k (T_common - T_k)^2` is minimized across all streams.
    *   For event-based synchronization, if `E_common` is a shared event marker:
        `Offset_k = T_common_event - T_k_event`
        `T_k_aligned = T_k + Offset_k`

*   **Output:** Cleaned, synchronized raw multimodal data streams, attributed to specific participants and timestamps, stored in `DATA_BUFFER`.
    `D_buffer(t) = { (Participant_p, {EEG_p(t), ECG_p(t), EDA_p(t), ET_p(t), Cam_p(t), Mic_p(t), ...}) | for each participant p }`

*   **4.1. Temporal Alignment and Synchronization (TEMP_ALIGN):**
    *   This sub-module ensures precise synchronization between the linguistic graph's entity/event timestamps and the incoming somatic-cognitive feature timestamps. It may involve interpolating somatic data to match linguistic events or aggregating somatic data over linguistic utterance durations.
    *   Let `T_L` be the timestamp for linguistic event `e_L` and `T_S` for somatic feature `f_S`.
    *   `Matching(e_L, f_S)` if `|T_L - T_S| <= Delta_T`, where `Delta_T` is a predefined temporal window.
    *   Somatic feature vector for a linguistic event: `Z_event = Aggregate(Z_p(t) | t in [T_L_start, T_L_end])`
        `Z_event = mean(Z_p(t))` or `max(Z_p(t))` depending on feature type.

*   **4.2. Contextual Encoder Multimodal AI (CONTEXT_ENC):**
    *   Utilizes a multimodal transformer architecture, for example, a cross-modal attention mechanism, to jointly process linguistic embeddings (from the CSTFN of previous invention) and somatic-cognitive feature vectors. This creates a unified contextual embedding space where linguistic and embodied signals are semantically fused.
    *   Input: Linguistic embedding `E_L` and somatic embedding `E_S` for a given time window.
    *   `E_Multimodal = Transformer( [E_L; E_S] )`
    *   Cross-attention mechanism: `Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q K^T / sqrt(d_k)) V`
        `Q_L = E_L W_Q_L`, `K_S = E_S W_K_S`, `V_S = E_S W_V_S`
        `E_L_to_S = Attention(Q_L, K_S, V_S)`
        `Q_S = E_S W_Q_S`, `K_L = E_L W_K_L`, `V_L = E_L W_V_L`
        `E_S_to_L = Attention(Q_S, K_L, V_L)`
        The final multimodal embedding `H_MM` combines `E_L_to_S` and `E_S_to_L`:
        `H_MM = F_fusion(E_L, E_S, E_L_to_S, E_S_to_L)`
    *   This encoder learns how specific words or concepts correlate with particular physiological responses and vice versa, in context.

*   **4.3. Cross-Modal Relational Inference (CROSS_MOD_INF):**
    *   Based on the joint multimodal embeddings `H_MM`, this module infers new types of relationships that span linguistic and embodied dimensions.
    *   **Linguistic-Somatic Links:** E.g., `Concept 'Budget Cuts' EVOKES_AFFECT 'High Stress' in 'Speaker A'`.
        `P(EVOKES_AFFECT | Concept_Emb, AffectiveState_Emb, Speaker_Emb) = Sigmoid(f(Concept_Emb, AffectiveState_Emb, Speaker_Emb))`
    *   **Somatic-Somatic Links:** E.g., `Speaker A 'High Stress' TRANSFERS_TO 'Speaker B' 'Elevated Stress'`.
        `P(TRANSFERS_TO | AffectA_Emb, AffectB_Emb, SpeakerA_Emb, SpeakerB_Emb, TimeLag) = Sigmoid(g(...))`
    *   **Behavioral-Cognitive Links:** E.g., `Speaker C 'Decreased Gaze' INDICATES_COGNITION 'Disengagement'`.
    *   **Decision-Affect Links:** E.g., `Decision 'Project Green Light' IS_ASSOCIATED_WITH 'Collective Excitement'`.
    *   This inference is typically performed by a relational prediction model, often a Graph Neural Network (GNN) operating on `H_MM`.
        `E_Rel_infer = GNN(H_MM, Initial_Edges)`

*   **4.4. Somatic-Cognitive KG Augmentation Module (SOM_KG_GEN):**
    *   Dynamically introduces new node types into the knowledge graph:
        *   `AffectiveState`: E.g., `Engagement`, `Frustration`, `Agreement`, `Disagreement`, `Excitement`, `Boredom`.
        *   `CognitiveState`: E.g., `Focus`, `Confusion`, `CognitiveLoad`, `DecisionUncertainty`.
        *   `SomaticMarker`: Direct physiological observations, e.g., `HRVDrop`, `EDASpike`.
    *   Augments existing `Speaker` nodes with real-time `AffectiveState` and `CognitiveState` attributes.
    *   Introduces new edge types reflecting the inferred cross-modal relationships, such as `EVOKES_AFFECT`, `INDICATES_COGNITION`, `IS_MANIFESTED_BY`, `INFLUENCES_DECISION`, `EXHIBITS_SYNCHRONY_WITH`, `TRIGGERS_RESPONSE`, `EXPRESSES_INTENTION`.
    *   For a linguistic node `n_L`, its attribute vector `alpha_L` is updated to `alpha'_L = [alpha_L, affect_L, cogn_L]`.
    *   New somatic node `n_S = (id_S, label_S, type_S, {participant_id, timestamp, intensity, confidence, source_metrics})`

*   **4.5. Semantic Fusion Optimization (SEM_FUSION_OPT):**
    *   Applies graph refinement techniques, such as knowledge graph completion algorithms on multimodal embeddings, to ensure consistency and infer latent relationships. Uses dynamic graph convolutional networks (GCNs) or graph attention networks (GATs) over the multimodal graph to propagate and refine semantic and affective states across the graph.
    *   Graph Convolutional Layer `H_l+1 = sigma(A H_l W_l)` where `A` is the adjacency matrix of the `Embodied Gamma`.
    *   Graph Attention Layer `H_l+1_i = sigma(sum_{j in N(i)} alpha_ij W H_l_j)` where `alpha_ij` are attention coefficients.
    *   Consistency checking: If `(A EVOKES_AFFECT B)` and `(B IS_MANIFESTED_BY C)`, infer `(A MAY_IMPLY C)`.
    *   Optimization objective: `L_fusion = L_node_classification + L_edge_prediction + L_consistency`

*   **4.6. Dynamic Graph Update Module (DYN_GRAPH_UPDATE_MOD):**
    *   Manages the real-time incremental updates to the ESCKG, ensuring efficiency and responsiveness. New nodes and edges are added, and existing attributes are updated based on the continuous stream of linguistic and somatic-cognitive data.
    *   Graph update operation: `Gamma_ESCKG(t+1) = Update(Gamma_ESCKG(t), New_Nodes(t), New_Edges(t), Updated_Attributes(t))`

*   **Output:** The comprehensive Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph ESCKG, a structured JSON object containing all linguistic, affective, and cognitive entities and their interconnections.
    `ESCKG = (N_ESCKG, E_ESCKG)`

**Formal Graph Definitions:**

Let `N_L` be the set of linguistic nodes, `N_S` the set of somatic-cognitive nodes.
`N_ESCKG = N_L U N_S`
Let `E_L` be the set of linguistic edges, `E_CMM` the set of cross-modal edges.
`E_ESCKG = E_L U E_CMM`

Node `n` in `N_ESCKG` has attributes `Attr(n) = (label, type, speaker_attribution, timestamp_context, multimodal_embedding, affect, cognition, somatic_metrics, confidence, ...)`
Edge `e` in `E_ESCKG` has attributes `Attr(e) = (source, target, type, confidence, temporal_lag, causal_strength, multimodal_embedding, ...)`

The Multimodal Embedding for a node `n_k` is `Emb(n_k) = H_MM(n_k)`.
The Multimodal Embedding for an edge `e_j` is `Emb(e_j) = H_MM(source_j, target_j, relation_type_j)`.

The graph `Embodied Gamma` is formally defined as a tuple `(V, E, A_V, A_E, M)` where:
*   `V = N_ESCKG` is the set of vertices.
*   `E = E_ESCKG` is the set of directed edges.
*   `A_V: V -> P(R^D_V)` is a function mapping each vertex to its attribute vector.
*   `A_E: E -> P(R^D_E)` is a function mapping each edge to its attribute vector.
*   `M` is the global meeting metadata.

*   **6.1. Visual Encoding Module Enhanced (VIS_ENC_E):**
    *   **Nodes:** Linguistic nodes are dynamically augmented. For example, a "Concept" node might display an "aura" or pulsating glow whose color `C_affect` and intensity `I_affect` reflect the real-time collective sentiment or cognitive load associated with its discussion.
        `C_affect(t) = ColorMap(Valence(t))`
        `I_affect(t) = Normalization(Arousal(t))`
        "Speaker" nodes can be represented by avatars whose facial expressions or body postures are animated in real-time to reflect their inferred affective/cognitive state. New "AffectiveState" and "CognitiveState" nodes have distinct geometries and color palettes.
        `Avatar_Facial_AU(t) = MorphTargetBlend(AU_Intensities(t))`
    *   **Edges:** Emotional contagion or influence edges might be represented by animated, directional flows or subtle "sparkle" effects indicating the strength `S_edge` and direction `Dir_edge` of the transfer. Edge thickness for "INFLUENCES_DECISION" edges could correlate with the confidence of the physiological basis for that influence.
        `Edge_Thickness = f(Confidence(edge))`
        `Flow_Speed = g(CausalStrength(edge))`
    *   **Environmental Cues:** The ambient lighting, fog density, or background particle effects within the 3D environment can dynamically shift to reflect the overall mood or energy level of the meeting, providing an implicit emotional context.
        `Ambient_Light_Color = ColorMap(Collective_Valence(t))`
        `Fog_Density = h(Collective_Arousal(t))`

*   **6.2. 3D Layout Algorithms Augmented (LA_E):**
    *   The `E_layout` function from the previous invention is extended to include forces influenced by affective and cognitive states. For example, nodes representing "High Stress" from different speakers might cluster spatially or exhibit specific oscillation patterns. Nodes related to "Focused Attention" might be drawn into a clearer, more prominent region of the graph. Temporal layout can now also consider periods of heightened cognitive activity or emotional intensity.
    *   The extended energy function `E_layout(P, Embodied Gamma)` is:
        `E_layout(P, Embodied Gamma) = sum_{k<l} (||P_k - P_l|| - delta_E(n_k, n_l))^2 + lambda_rep sum_{k!=l} Phi(||P_k - P_l||) + lambda_hier sum_{k} Psi(P_k, Hier(n_k_E)) + lambda_temp sum_{k} Xi(P_k, Temp(n_k_E)) + lambda_affect sum_{k} F_affect(P_k, affect_k) + lambda_cogn sum_{k} F_cogn(P_k, cogn_k) + lambda_sync sum_{k,l} F_sync(P_k, P_l, Sync_kl)`
        Where:
        *   `delta_E(n_k, n_l)`: Graph-theoretic distance between `n_k` and `n_l` in `Embodied Gamma`, now reflecting multimodal similarity (semantic + affective + cognitive similarity). This ensures that nodes closely related across any modality are visually close.
            `delta_E(n_k, n_l) = w_L * dist(n_k, n_l)_LKG + w_S * dist(n_k, n_l)_Somatic + w_C * dist(n_k, n_l)_CrossModal`
        *   `lambda_affect sum_{k} F_affect(P_k, affect_k)`: A new affective influence term.
            `F_affect(P_k, affect_k) = Force_Repulsion_Attraction(affect_k_valence) + Force_Oscillation(affect_k_arousal)`
        *   `lambda_cogn sum_{k} F_cogn(P_k, cogn_k)`: A new cognitive influence term.
            `F_cogn(P_k, cogn_k) = Force_Clarity(cogn_k_focus) + Force_Dispersion(cogn_k_load)`
        *   `lambda_sync sum_{k,l} F_sync(P_k, P_l, Sync_kl)`: A new synchrony force, pulling or pushing nodes based on inter-participant synchrony.
            `F_sync(P_k, P_l, Sync_kl) = k_sync * (Sync_kl - Threshold_sync) * (P_k - P_l) / ||P_k - P_l||`

*   **6.3. Interaction Subsystem Multimodal (INT_SUB_E):**
    *   **Affective/Cognitive Filtering:** Users can filter the graph to "Show only moments of collective high stress," "Identify decisions made under low cognitive load," or "Trace emotional propagation paths."
        `Filter_query(ESCKG, {type='AffectiveState', emotion='stress', intensity > 0.7})`
    *   **Somatic Replay:** Enables replay of specific conversational segments, synchronizing linguistic content with the real-time physiological and behavioral animations of participants' avatars or node auras.
        `Replay_function(ESCKG, Time_segment) -> Synchronized_Visual_Audio_Playback`
    *   **Embodied Detail Panels:** Clicking on a node or avatar reveals not only linguistic details but also granular physiological graphs (e.g., HRV over time, EEG spectrograms) and behavioral heatmaps (e.g., facial action unit intensity) for that specific temporal context.
        `Display_Details(Node_ID) -> {Text_Linguistic, Charts_Physiological, Video_Behavioral_Snippet}`
    *   **Sonification of Affective/Cognitive States (SONIFICATION_MODULE):** Maps changes in affective or cognitive states to auditory cues (e.g., rising pitch for increasing stress, shifting timbre for changes in engagement), providing an additional, non-visual channel for data interpretation.
        `Audio_Cue(t) = Map_Affect_to_Sound(Affect_State(t))`

**Mathematical Justification:**

The formal extension of our previous mathematical framework is necessary to precisely define the integration and semantic fusion of linguistic data with multi-modal somatic and cognitive signals. We introduce the concept of a Multimodal Somatic-Cognitive Tensor `Psi_C` and the transformation function `G_MM_AI` that yields the Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph `Embodied Gamma`.

### I. Formal Definition of a Multimodal Discursive Artifact `C_MM` and its Somatic-Cognitive Tensor `Psi_C`

Let a multimodal discursive artifact `C_MM` be an extension of the linguistic artifact `C`, augmented with real-time physiological and behavioral observations. `C_MM` is defined as a finite, ordered sequence of multimodal observation tuples, `C_MM = ((u_1, phi_1), (u_2, phi_2), ..., (u_n, phi_n))`, where `n` is the total number of synchronized observation points. Each observation point `i` includes the linguistic utterance `u_i` (as defined in the previous invention) and a vector `phi_i` encompassing multi-modal physiological and behavioral data for all participants `m` at that temporal segment.

$$ \phi_i = \{ (spk_j, P_{j,i}, B_{j,i}) \mid \forall spk_j \in \Sigma \} \quad (1) $$

Where:
*   `spk_j` in `Sigma`: The speaker identifier, `Sigma = {spk_1, ..., spk_M}` where `M` is the number of participants.
*   `P_{j,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{D_p}`: A vector of raw physiological signals for speaker `j` at time `i`, including EEG, ECG, EDA, EMG readings.
*   `B_{j,i} \in \mathbb{R}^{D_b}`: A vector of raw behavioral signals for speaker `j` at time `i`, including facial landmark coordinates, gaze vectors, body pose keypoints, and raw prosodic features.

These raw signals are processed by the **Physiological and Behavioral Feature Extraction Core** into higher-level feature vectors `zeta_{j,i}` for each speaker `j` at time `i`. Let `F_{Extract}` be the feature extraction function:

$$ \zeta_{j,i} = F_{Extract}(P_{j,i}, B_{j,i}) \quad (2) $$

Where `zeta_{j,i}` is a concatenated vector:
$$ \zeta_{j,i} = [HRV_{j,i}, EDA_{j,i}, EEG_{j,i}, Eye_{j,i}, Face_{j,i}, Body_{j,i}, Pros_{j,i}, EMG_{j,i}, Haptic_{j,i}] \quad (3) $$

Each component is a sub-vector of extracted features, e.g., `HRV_{j,i}` contains time-domain and frequency-domain HRV metrics:
$$ HRV_{j,i} = [SDNN_{j,i}, RMSSD_{j,i}, LF_{j,i}, HF_{j,i}, LF/HF_{j,i}] \quad (4) $$
$$ SCL_{j,i} = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int_{t_i-\Delta t/2}^{t_i+\Delta t/2} EDA_{j}(t) dt \quad (5) $$
$$ SCR\_Count_{j,i} = \sum_{k} \mathbb{I}(\text{peak in } SCR_{j}(t_k) \text{ in interval } i) \quad (6) $$
EEG band power features: `PSD_{band}` for `band \in \{\text{Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma}\}` for each electrode `e`.
$$ EEG_{j,i} = [PSD_{j,i,e,band} \mid \forall e, band] \quad (7) $$
Facial Action Unit (AU) intensities `I_{j,i,au}`:
$$ Face_{j,i} = [I_{j,i,AU_1}, I_{j,i,AU_2}, \ldots, I_{j,i,AU_K}] \quad (8) $$
Prosodic features:
$$ Pros_{j,i} = [F0_{mean}, F0_{std}, Intensity_{mean}, Jitter, Shimmer, SpeakingRate]_{j,i} \quad (9) $$

The extracted features are then classified by a function `C_{classify}` into affective and cognitive states `S_{j,i}`:
$$ S_{j,i} = C_{classify}(\zeta_{j,i}) \quad (10) $$
Where `S_{j,i} = (A_{j,i}, Cg_{j,i}, Conf_{j,i})`, representing affective state, cognitive state, and confidence.
$$ P(state | \zeta) = \text{softmax}(W \cdot \zeta + b) \quad (11) $$
The entire multimodal discursive artifact `C_MM` is mapped into a **Multimodal Somatic-Cognitive Tensor** `Psi_C`. `Psi_C` is a higher-order data structure that integrates the linguistic semantic tensor `S_C` with the physiological and behavioral feature streams.

Let `Psi_C` be a tensor of rank `k'`, where its dimensions conceptually represent:
$$ \Psi_C \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times (D_{\epsilon} + D_S) \times D_{\Sigma} \times D_{Att}} \quad (12) $$
*   `T`: Number of time segments/utterances.
*   `D_{\epsilon}`: Dimensionality of utterance embeddings `epsilon_i`.
*   `D_S`: Dimensionality of aggregated somatic-cognitive feature embeddings `Z_i` (composite of all `zeta_{j,i}` for all speakers `j` at time `i`).
*   `D_{\Sigma}`: Dimensionality representing speaker identity and characteristics (e.g., one-hot encoding or learned embeddings).
*   `D_{Att}`: Dimensionality representing other attributes or metadata per segment.

The construction of `Psi_C` involves:
1.  **Linguistic Semantic Embedding:** `u_i \rightarrow \epsilon_i` (as before).
2.  **Somatic-Cognitive Embedding:** `\phi_i \rightarrow Z_i` (via feature extraction and potentially further deep embedding). This aggregates `S_{j,i}` for all `j`.
    $$ Z_i = \text{Aggregate}_{j \in \Sigma} (S_{j,i}) \quad (13) $$
3.  **Cross-Modal Joint Embedding:** A multimodal transformer, forming the core of the `Contextual Encoder Multimodal AI`, computes weighted sums across `\epsilon_j` and `Z_k` dimensions, considering temporal proximity and speaker attribution. This generates a dense, unified `Psi_C` that explicitly models the interplay between linguistic and embodied signals.
    Let `H_L(t)` be the linguistic embedding and `H_S(t)` be the somatic-cognitive embedding for time `t`.
    $$ Q_L(t) = H_L(t) W_{Q_L}, \quad K_S(t) = H_S(t) W_{K_S}, \quad V_S(t) = H_S(t) W_{V_S} \quad (14) $$
    $$ Att_{L \rightarrow S}(t) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{Q_L(t) K_S(t)^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V_S(t) \quad (15) $$
    Similarly for `Att_{S \rightarrow L}(t)`.
    The fused multimodal representation `H_{MM}(t)` is:
    $$ H_{MM}(t) = \text{LayerNorm}(\text{Concat}(H_L(t), Att_{L \rightarrow S}(t), H_S(t), Att_{S \rightarrow L}(t)) \cdot W_{Fusion}) \quad (16) $$
    This `H_{MM}(t)` forms the basis of the `Psi_C` tensor, representing the contextualized multimodal state at each time point.

### II. The Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph `Embodied Gamma` and the Transformation Function `G_MM_AI`

The present invention defines a superior representation of `C_MM` as an attributed Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph `Embodied Gamma = (N_E, E_E)`. The transformation from `Psi_C` to `Embodied Gamma` is mediated by the sophisticated generative AI function `G_MM_AI`:

$$ G_{MM\_AI}: \Psi_C \rightarrow \text{Embodied Gamma}(N_E, E_E) \quad (17) $$

Where:
*   `N_E` is an extended finite set of richly attributed nodes `N_E = N_L \cup N_S`, where `N_L` are linguistic nodes and `N_S` are somatic-cognitive nodes. Each node `n_k` in `N_E` is a formalized representation of an extracted entity (concept, decision, action item, speaker, affective state, cognitive state, somatic marker, behavioral pattern).
    $$ n_k = (id_k, label_k, type_k, \alpha_k) \quad (18) $$
    Where `alpha_k` is an extended vector of attributes for node `k`, potentially including:
    *   `v_k \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{ne}}`: A multimodal node embedding. `v_k = H_{MM}(k)` or a derived embedding.
    *   `affect_k \in [-1, 1]^2`: Inferred affective state (e.g., valence-arousal scores).
    *   `cogn_k \in [0, 1]`: Inferred cognitive state (e.g., cognitive load, focus level).
    *   `somatic_features_k \in \mathbb{R}^{D_{somatic}}`: Key raw or processed somatic features.
    *   `participant_k`: The speaker associated.
    *   `timestamp_context_k`, `confidence_k`, `level_k`, `original_utterance_ids_k`, `original_signal_timestamps_k`.
*   `E_E` is an extended finite set of richly attributed, directed edges `E_E = E_L \cup E_{CMM}`, where `E_L` are linguistic edges and `E_{CMM}` are cross-modal edges. Each edge `e_j` in `E_E` represents a specific typed relationship between two nodes `n_a` and `n_b` in `N_E`.
    $$ e_j = (source_{id}, target_{id}, relation\_type_j, \beta_j) \quad (19) $$
    Where `beta_j` is an extended vector of attributes for edge `j`, including:
    *   `w_j \in [0, 1]`: Confidence score or strength.
    *   `affect_impact_j`: Quantitative measure of affective influence.
    *   `cogn_impact_j`: Quantitative measure of cognitive influence.
    *   `temporal_lag_j`: Time difference for influence propagation.
    *   `causal_strength_j \in [0,1]`: Strength of inferred causal link.

The transformation `G_MM_AI` involves:
1.  **Linguistic & Somatic-Cognitive Entity Extraction:** `E_{extract\_MM}: \Psi_C \rightarrow N_E`. This involves clustering across the joint multimodal embedding space to identify linguistic, affective, and cognitive entities.
    $$ n_k \leftarrow \text{Cluster}(H_{MM}(t_k), \text{threshold}) \quad (20) $$
    Type assignment: `type(n_k) = \text{Classifier}(v_k)`
2.  **Multimodal Relational Inference:** `R_{infer\_MM}: \Psi_C \times N_E \times N_E \rightarrow E_E`. This crucial step, implemented via multimodal GNNs or attention over `Psi_C`, identifies linguistic-linguistic, linguistic-somatic, somatic-linguistic, and somatic-somatic relationships (e.g., `CONCEPT EVOKES_AFFECT SOMATIC_STATE`, `SPEAKER_A_STRESS INFLUENCES SPEAKER_B_FOCUS`).
    A GNN computes node embeddings `h_v^{(l+1)}` at layer `l+1`:
    $$ h_v^{(l+1)} = \sigma \left( \sum_{u \in \mathcal{N}(v)} \frac{1}{c_{vu}} W^{(l)} h_u^{(l)} \right) \quad (21) $$
    For relation prediction `(n_a, r, n_b)`:
    $$ P(r | n_a, n_b) = \text{sigmoid}(f_{\text{rel}}(h_{n_a}, h_{n_b})) \quad (22) $$
    Where `f_{rel}` is a scoring function, possibly a bilinear form `h_{n_a}^T R_r h_{n_b}` for relation `r`.
    The confidence `w_j` is directly `P(r | n_a, n_b)`.
    Causal strength `Causal_Strength(X \rightarrow Y)` can be derived from Granger Causality:
    $$ P(X_t | X_{t-1}, Y_{t-1}) \neq P(X_t | X_{t-1}) \quad (23) $$
    where `P` is a prediction model.
3.  **Hierarchical & Temporal Induction (Extended):** `H_{T\_induce\_MM}: N_E \times E_E \rightarrow (N_E', E_E')`. This refines `Embodied Gamma` by identifying hierarchical structures that now include affective and cognitive clusters, and by establishing temporal sequences for both linguistic and embodied events.
    The hierarchy is defined by parent-child relationships `(n_parent, CONTAINS, n_child)`.
    Temporal ordering: `(e_1, PRECEDES, e_2)` if `t(e_1) < t(e_2)`.

The dimensionality and information content of `Embodied Gamma` is demonstrably higher than `Gamma` (from the previous invention), as it captures the intricate interplay between expressed content and embodied experience.

### III. The Enhanced 3D Volumetric Rendering Function `R_E` and Spatial Embedding for Embodied Data

The Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph `Embodied Gamma` is mapped into an enhanced three-dimensional Euclidean space `\mathbb{R}^3` by a rendering function `R_E`:

$$ R_E: \text{Embodied Gamma} \rightarrow \{ (P_k, O_k) \}_{k=1}^{|N_E|} \cup \{ (P_j, C_j) \}_{j=1}^{|E_E|} \quad (24) $$
Where `P_k \in \mathbb{R}^3` are the spatial positions of nodes, `O_k` are their visual objects/attributes, `P_j` are the path definitions for edges, and `C_j` are their visual characteristics.

The core innovation for `R_E` lies in extending the energy function `E_{layout}(P, \text{Embodied Gamma})` to account for embodied attributes:

$$ E_{layout}(P, \text{Embodied Gamma}) = \sum_{k<l} (\|P_k - P_l\| - \delta_E(n_k, n_l))^2 \quad (25) $$
$$ + \lambda_{rep} \sum_{k \neq l} \Phi(\|P_k - P_l\|) \quad (26) $$
$$ + \lambda_{hier} \sum_{k} \Psi(P_k, \text{Hier}(n_k)) \quad (27) $$
$$ + \lambda_{temp} \sum_{k} \Xi(P_k, \text{Temp}(n_k)) \quad (28) $$
$$ + \lambda_{affect} \sum_{k} F_{affect}(P_k, affect_k) \quad (29) $$
$$ + \lambda_{cogn} \sum_{k} F_{cogn}(P_k, cogn_k) \quad (30) $$
$$ + \lambda_{sync} \sum_{k,l} F_{sync}(P_k, P_l, Sync_{kl}) \quad (31) $$
$$ + \lambda_{spk} \sum_{k} F_{speaker}(P_k, \text{Speaker}(n_k)) \quad (32) $$

Where:
*   `\delta_E(n_k, n_l)`: Graph-theoretic distance between `n_k` and `n_l` in `Embodied Gamma`, now reflecting multimodal similarity (semantic + affective + cognitive similarity).
    $$ \delta_E(n_k, n_l) = w_L \cdot d_L(n_k, n_l) + w_S \cdot d_S(n_k, n_l) + w_{CMM} \cdot d_{CMM}(n_k, n_l) \quad (33) $$
    Where `d_L`, `d_S`, `d_{CMM}` are distances in linguistic, somatic, and cross-modal embedding spaces, respectively.
*   `\Phi(\|P_k - P_l\|)`: Repulsion term to prevent node overlap, e.g., `1/\|P_k - P_l\|^2`.
*   `\Psi(P_k, \text{Hier}(n_k))`: Hierarchical forces.
*   `\Xi(P_k, \text{Temp}(n_k))`: Temporal forces, positioning nodes chronologically.
*   `\lambda_{affect} \sum_{k} F_{affect}(P_k, affect_k)`: A new affective influence term.
    $$ F_{affect}(P_k, affect_k) = k_{val} \cdot (affect_k^{valence} - \mu_{valence}) P_k + k_{aro} \cdot affect_k^{arousal} \cdot \sin(\omega t) \quad (34) $$
    This term drives visual properties like color, glow intensity, or animation based on `affect_k`. For instance, high arousal nodes might oscillate more.
    Visual mapping for node color `C(n_k)`:
    $$ C(n_k) = \text{ColorGradient}(\text{Valence}(affect_k)) \quad (35) $$
    Visual mapping for node aura intensity `I_{aura}(n_k)`:
    $$ I_{aura}(n_k) = \text{Sigmoid}(\text{Arousal}(affect_k)) \quad (36) $$
*   `\lambda_{cogn} \sum_{k} F_{cogn}(P_k, cogn_k)`: A new cognitive influence term.
    $$ F_{cogn}(P_k, cogn_k) = k_{focus} \cdot (cogn_k^{focus} - \mu_{focus}) \sum_{l \in \text{related}(k)} (P_k - P_l) \quad (37) $$
    This term modulates visual properties like node size, opacity, or sharpness based on `cogn_k` (e.g., larger/clearer for high focus, smaller/fainter for low engagement).
    Node size `Size(n_k)`:
    $$ Size(n_k) = S_{base} + k_{size} \cdot \text{CognitiveLoad}(cogn_k) \quad (38) $$
*   `\lambda_{sync} \sum_{k,l} F_{sync}(P_k, P_l, Sync_{kl})`: Inter-participant synchrony forces.
    $$ F_{sync}(P_k, P_l, Sync_{kl}) = K_{sync} \cdot (Sync_{kl} - T_{sync}) \cdot \frac{P_k - P_l}{\|P_k - P_l\|} \quad (39) $$
    Where `Sync_{kl}` is the synchrony score between participants associated with nodes `k` and `l`, and `T_{sync}` is a threshold.
*   `\lambda_{spk} \sum_{k} F_{speaker}(P_k, \text{Speaker}(n_k))`: Forces grouping nodes by speaker.
    $$ F_{speaker}(P_k, \text{Speaker}(n_k)) = K_{spk} \cdot (P_k - P_{\text{centroid}(\text{Speaker}(n_k))}) \quad (40) $$

The minimization of this extended `E_{layout}` function produces a 3D visualization where spatial proximity and visual attributes reflect not only semantic and temporal relationships but also the intricate affective and cognitive dynamics of the discourse.

### IV. Proof of Superiority: Informational Richness and Embodied Cognitive Understanding

The superiority of the Embodied Somatic-Cognitive Knowledge Graph `Embodied Gamma` and its `\mathbb{R}^3` visualization over both linear textual summaries `T` and purely linguistic knowledge graphs `Gamma` is established through analysis of informational entropy and the profound enhancement of embodied cognitive understanding.

1.  **Informational Entropy and Multimodal Topological Preservation:**
    *   Let `H(X)` be the information entropy of a representation `X`.
    *   The raw multimodal data `C_MM` is a high-dimensional, temporally evolving signal. Its entropy `H(C_MM)` is extremely high.
    *   The transformation `G_{MM\_AI}` from `\Psi_C` to `Embodied Gamma` aims to be maximally information-preserving concerning salient discursive dynamics while reducing noise.
    *   `H(\text{Embodied Gamma} | C_{MM})` represents the residual uncertainty in `Embodied Gamma` given `C_MM`.
    *   The information gain `IG = H(C_{MM}) - H(\text{Embodied Gamma} | C_{MM})` is maximized.
    *   While `IG(Gamma | C)` represents significant information preservation over `T`, `IG(\text{Embodied Gamma} | C_{MM})` is orders of magnitude greater.
    *   The `G_{MM\_AI}` function captures the intricate, often implicit, relationships between spoken words, felt emotions, and cognitive processing, which are entirely absent in `Gamma`.
    *   `Embodied Gamma` explicitly encodes previously unrepresented modalities (physiological and behavioral data), allowing for the quantification of new graph-theoretic metrics, such as emotional flow centrality, cognitive load distribution, or decision-making influence based on somatic markers.
        *   **Emotional Flow Centrality (EFC):** For a node `n_k`, `EFC(n_k) = \sum_{j \in \text{influences}(n_k)} w(n_k \rightarrow n_j)^{affect\_impact}`.
        *   **Cognitive Load Network Density (CLND):** `CLND(t) = \frac{\sum_{p \in \Sigma} CognitiveLoad_p(t)}{|\Sigma|}`.
        *   **Decision Affective Robustness (DAR):** `DAR(decision) = 1 - \text{StdDev}(CollectiveAffect_{decision}) / \text{Mean}(CollectiveAffect_{decision})`.
    *   The ability to model inter-speaker emotional contagion or the impact of stress on decision nodes fundamentally deepens the structural understanding of the discourse.
    *   The number of possible node types `|N_{types\_ESCKG}| = |N_{types\_LKG}| + |N_{types\_Somatic}|`.
    *   The number of possible edge types `|E_{types\_ESCKG}| = |E_{types\_LKG}| + |E_{types\_CrossModal}|`.
    *   The increase in the state space complexity `S_E = \prod_{n \in N_E} |\text{Attr}(n)| \cdot \prod_{e \in E_E} |\text{Attr}(e)|` compared to `S_L` for linguistic graphs demonstrates higher informational density.
    *   The mapping of `C_MM` to `\Psi_C` and then to `Embodied Gamma` is a maximally information-preserving transformation within the defined multi-modal context, significantly reducing the entropy of the representation relative to the original complex human interaction.

2.  **Embodied Cognitive and Affective Efficiency:**
    *   By integrating `affect_k` and `cogn_k` into the 3D visualization via `R_E`, the system directly taps into fundamental human perceptual and emotional processing capabilities. Users can:
        *   **Holistic Perception:** Instantly grasp the emotional tenor and cognitive intensity of a discussion segment, complementing linguistic understanding.
            `P_{interpret}(\text{Embodied Gamma}) > P_{interpret}(\text{Gamma})` where `P_{interpret}` is probability of correct interpretation.
        *   **Empathy and Context:** Develop a richer, more empathetic understanding of participants' perspectives by directly visualizing their embodied states during key moments.
            `Empathy_Score = f(\text{Visualization Fidelity of Affective States})`.
        *   **Identify Implicit Dynamics:** Quickly spot emotional hotspots, moments of collective confusion, or periods of high collaborative engagement that would be invisible in purely linguistic or even traditional `Gamma` representations.
            `Detection_Rate_{implicit\_dynamics}(\text{ESCKG}) \gg Detection_Rate_{implicit\_dynamics}(\text{LKG})`.
        *   **Enhanced Decision Analysis:** Evaluate decisions not just by their content, but by the emotional and cognitive environment in which they were formed, leading to more robust post-mortem analyses and improved future decision-making processes.
            `Decision_Quality\_Prediction = w_1 \cdot Linguistic\_Factors + w_2 \cdot Affective\_Factors + w_3 \cdot Cognitive\_Factors`.
            `Improvement\_Factor = \frac{Accuracy(DQ_{ESCKG})}{Accuracy(DQ_{LKG})}`.
    *   The extended `E_{layout}` function ensures that these embodied dimensions are visually encoded and spatially arranged in a manner that minimizes cognitive effort for interpretation, making complex socio-cognitive dynamics immediately apparent and navigable.
        `CognitiveLoad_{user}(\text{ESCKG}) < CognitiveLoad_{user}(\text{Gamma})` for tasks requiring embodied insight.
    *   The interactive `Somatic Replay` functionality enables a `time-series contextualization` that cannot be achieved with static graphs.
        `Replay Fidelity = \sum_t \|V_{ESCKG}(t) - V_{Truth}(t)\|_F^2`.
    *   The integration of sonification provides a redundant coding scheme, enhancing accessibility and reinforcing the embodied meaning.
        `Information Redundancy R = H(\text{Visual}) + H(\text{Auditory}) - H(\text{Visual, Auditory})`. Maximizing `R`.
    *   The XAI features provide local interpretability `L(x) = \sum_i w_i x_i`, where `w_i` is the importance of feature `i`.
    *   The Causal Inference Engine calculates `P(Effect|Do(Cause))` to quantify interventions.
    *   Anomaly detection `AD(x) = \text{Score}(x) > \tau` helps identify critical states.

The present invention does not merely add data; it transforms the fundamental representation of human discourse by semantically fusing linguistic content with the embodied human experience. This leads to an unprecedented level of informational richness and an intuitively graspable, multi-dimensional understanding of how ideas are formed, felt, and influenced within complex social interactions. `Q.E.D.`
