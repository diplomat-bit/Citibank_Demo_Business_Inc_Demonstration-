**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Generative Cinematic Storyboarding

**Abstract:**
A system for pre-visualizing cinematic sequences is disclosed. A user provides a script or a scene description. The system uses a generative AI model to create a complete storyboard for the scene. The output is a sequence of images, where each image is generated based on the script and includes suggested camera angles, lighting, and character posing, dramatically accelerating the pre-production process for filmmakers.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
A director inputs a scene: "A tense close-up of a character defusing a bomb, sweat on their brow." The system prompts an image generation model: `Generate a cinematic storyboard panel for: [scene description]. Style: "thriller", Camera Angle: "extreme close-up on hands", Lighting: "single overhead light".` The system can be prompted to generate a sequence of such shots to visualize the entire scene.

**Claims:**
1. A method for creating a storyboard, comprising:
   a. Receiving a text description of a cinematic scene.
   b. Using a generative AI image model to create a plurality of images representing shots within the scene.
   c. Arranging the images in sequence to form a storyboard.
