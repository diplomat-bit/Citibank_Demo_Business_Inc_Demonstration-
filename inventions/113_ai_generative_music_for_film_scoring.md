**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Film Scoring from Video and Script Analysis

**Abstract:**
A system for automated film and video scoring is disclosed. The system ingests a video clip and its corresponding script or scene description. A multi-modal AI model analyzes the visual content (pacing, color, action) and the script's emotional tone. Based on this analysis, it generates a custom, perfectly synchronized musical score that matches the scene's dynamic emotional arc.

**Detailed Description:**
A film editor uploads a 2-minute scene of a car chase. The AI analyzes the video, noting the fast cuts and high motion. It analyzes the script, noting the dialogue is tense. It is prompted to "Generate a tense, high-BPM, orchestral score that builds to a crescendo as the car goes over the bridge at 01:32." The AI music model generates an audio track where the musical climax is perfectly timed to the key moment in the video.

**Claims:**
1. A method for film scoring, comprising:
   a. Receiving a video clip and a text description of its desired emotional tone.
   b. Analyzing the visual content and the text using a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to compose a musical score that is synchronized with and emotionally appropriate for the video clip.
   d. Layering the generated musical score onto the video clip.
