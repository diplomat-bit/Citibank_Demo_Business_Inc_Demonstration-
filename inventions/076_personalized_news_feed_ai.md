**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for a Personalized, Summarized News Feed

**Abstract:**
A system for news consumption is disclosed. The system monitors a user's reading habits and explicitly stated interests. It scours a vast array of news sources and selects a small number of articles highly relevant to the user. A generative AI model then summarizes each of these articles into a concise, single paragraph. The system presents the user with a daily "briefing" consisting of these AI-generated summaries, allowing them to stay informed in a fraction of the time.

**Detailed Description:**
The system learns a user's interests. A daily job finds relevant articles. For each article, it prompts an LLM: `Summarize this news article into one neutral, fact-based paragraph.` The collection of summaries is then presented as a personalized news feed.

**Claims:**
1. A method for providing news, comprising:
   a. Selecting articles based on a user's interests.
   b. For each article, using a generative AI to create a summary.
   c. Presenting the summaries to the user as a personalized news feed.
