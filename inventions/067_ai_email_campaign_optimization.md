**Title of Invention:** System and Method for AI-Driven Optimization of Email Marketing Campaigns

**Abstract:**
A system for optimizing email marketing is disclosed. A user provides the goal and content for an email campaign. The system uses a generative AI model to create multiple variations of the subject line and body copy. It then automatically runs a multi-variate test by sending these variations to a small subset of the audience. After analyzing the open and click-through rates, it identifies the winning combination and automatically sends that version to the rest of the mailing list.

**Detailed Description:**
In the Marketing Automation module, a user drafts an email. They enable "AI Optimization." The AI generates 5 subject lines and 3 body variations. The system sends these 15 combinations to 15% of the target list. After 2 hours, it determines which combination had the highest click-through rate and sends that one to the remaining 85%.

**Claims:**
1. A method for email marketing, comprising:
   a. Receiving base content for an email.
   b. Using a generative AI to create multiple variations of the content.
   c. Automatically sending the variations to a test audience.
   d. Analyzing the performance of each variation.
   e. Sending the best-performing variation to the remaining audience.
