# Satellite Constellation Topology Optimizer

## Purpose

This module provides functionalities to design and optimize satellite constellation topologies. The primary goals are to maximize Earth coverage and minimize the risk of orbital collisions. It employs algorithms to determine optimal orbital plane inclinations, altitudes, and number of satellites per plane.

## Features

*   **Coverage Analysis:**
    *   Calculate the ground coverage footprint of individual satellites and the entire constellation.
    *   Analyze revisit times for specific geographic locations.
    *   Quantify the percentage of Earth covered at any given time.

*   **Collision Risk Assessment:**
    *   Estimate the probability of collision between satellites within the constellation.
    *   Identify potential collision hotspots and at-risk orbital regimes.
    *   Integrate with space debris catalog data for more accurate risk assessment.

*   **Optimization Algorithms:**
    *   **Genetic Algorithms:** To search for optimal constellation parameters (number of planes, satellites per plane, inclination, altitude) that balance coverage and collision avoidance.
    *   **Simulated Annealing:** To iteratively refine constellation designs.
    *   **Coverage-Driven Placement:** Algorithms that prioritize placing satellites to ensure continuous coverage of target areas.
    *   **Collision-Aware Placement:** Algorithms that actively seek orbital parameters that reduce the likelihood of intersections.

*   **Topology Generation:**
    *   Generate common constellation topologies (e.g., Walker Delta, Walker Star, S-Nodal).
    *   Support custom, user-defined constellation configurations.

*   **Visualization:**
    *   3D visualization of satellite orbits and ground tracks.
    *   Heatmaps of coverage intensity and revisit times.
    *   Collision probability maps.

## Input Parameters

*   **Number of Satellites:** Total desired satellites in the constellation.
*   **Altitude Range:** Minimum and maximum orbital altitudes (e.g., LEO, MEO, GEO).
*   **Inclination Range:** Minimum and maximum orbital plane inclinations.
*   **Argument of Perigee Distribution:** How the argument of perigee is distributed across planes.
*   **Right Ascension of Ascending Node (RAAN) Spacing:** How RAANs are spaced for different orbital planes.
*   **Target Coverage Areas:** Specific geographic regions or global coverage requirements.
*   **Revisit Time Requirements:** Maximum acceptable time between satellite passes over a given point.
*   **Collision Avoidance Margins:** Minimum separation distance required between satellites.
*   **Debris Data Path:** Path to a file containing space debris catalog information.

## Output

*   **Optimal Constellation Parameters:**
    *   Number of orbital planes.
    *   Number of satellites per plane.
    *   Inclination of each plane.
    *   RAAN of each plane.
    *   Altitude of each plane.
    *   Phasing of satellites within planes.
*   **Coverage Metrics:**
    *   Percentage of Earth covered.
    *   Average and maximum revisit times.
    *   Coverage maps.
*   **Collision Risk Metrics:**
    *   Estimated collision probability.
    *   Identification of high-risk orbital intersections.
*   **Orbital Ephemerides:**
    *   TLEs (Two-Line Elements) or other ephemeris data for the designed constellation.
*   **Simulation Results:**
    *   Visualizations and reports of the constellation's performance.

## Usage Example (Conceptual Python API)

```python
from inventions.space.satellite_constellation_topology import ConstellationOptimizer

# Define requirements
num_satellites = 100
altitude_range = (500e3, 800e3) # meters
min_revisit_time_sec = 600
target_coverage_percentage = 99.0

# Initialize optimizer
optimizer = ConstellationOptimizer(
    num_satellites=num_satellites,
    altitude_range=altitude_range,
    min_revisit_time_sec=min_revisit_time_sec,
    target_coverage_percentage=target_coverage_percentage
)

# Run optimization
optimal_constellation = optimizer.optimize()

# Analyze results
coverage_report = optimizer.analyze_coverage(optimal_constellation)
collision_risk = optimizer.assess_collision_risk(optimal_constellation)

print("Optimal Constellation Configuration:", optimal_constellation)
print("Coverage Report:", coverage_report)
print("Collision Risk:", collision_risk)

# Generate ephemerides
ephemerides = optimizer.generate_ephemerides(optimal_constellation)
```

## Implementation Details

This module will likely leverage libraries for:

*   **Orbital Mechanics:** `poliastro`, `skyfield`, `sgp4` for propagating orbits and calculating positions.
*   **Optimization:** `scipy.optimize`, `DEAP` (for genetic algorithms).
