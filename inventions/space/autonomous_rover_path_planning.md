# Invention 042: Quantum-Probabilistic Terrain Traversal (QPTT) Engine

## 1. Overview
The QPTT Engine is a revolutionary navigation stack designed for autonomous rovers operating in highly volatile extraterrestrial environments (e.g., cryovolcanic moons, asteroid fields, or unstable dune seas). Unlike traditional SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) which relies on static geometry, QPTT treats terrain interaction as a stochastic fluid dynamic problem, allowing navigation through environments that shift while being traversed.

## 2. Core Innovations
*   **Granular Physics Oracle:** A dedicated onboard subsystem that simulates wheel-regolith interaction 50 steps into the future using Monte Carlo tree search, adjusting torque per-wheel in microseconds to prevent slippage before it occurs.
*   **Non-Deterministic Pathing:** Instead of calculating a single "best" path, the rover maintains a superposition of 100 potential trajectories. As sensor data resolves terrain ambiguity, the path function collapses into the safest immediate vector.
*   **Morphological Suspension:** The suspension struts contain electro-active polymers that change rigidity based on the frequency of vibrations detected from the ground, allowing the rover to "flow" over jagged rocks or stiffen on soft sand.

## 4. Logic Pseudocode

```python
class TerrainOracle:
    def __init__(self, sensor_array, chassis_config):
        self.sensors = sensor_array
        self.chassis = chassis_config
        self.trajectory_superposition = []

    def analyze_regolith(self, surface_patch):
        """
        Determines if surface acts as solid, fluid, or unstable aggregate.
        """
        viscosity = self.sensors.gpr.scan(surface_patch).viscosity_index
        roughness = self.sensors.lidar.get_roughness(surface_patch)
        thermal_instability = self.sensors.thermal.get_gradient(surface_patch)
        return PhysicsModel(viscosity, roughness, thermal_instability)

    def compute_next_vector(self, current_pose, goal):
        hazards = self.scan_hazards()
        
        # Generate probabilistic paths based on hazard entropy
        for i in range(100):
            # Simulate physics 50 steps ahead
            path = self.monte_carlo_simulate(current_pose, hazards, depth=50)
            self.trajectory_superposition.append(path)

        # Collapse function based on real-time haptic feedback form wheels
        # If wheel 1 slips, paths relying on wheel 1 traction are pruned immediately
        optimal_vector = self.collapse_wavefunction(
            self.trajectory_superposition, 
            self.sensors.haptic.current_traction_loss()
        )
        
        return optimal_vector

    def actuate_wheels(self, vector):
        # Independent Torque and Suspension Control
        for wheel in self.chassis.wheels:
            # Stiffen suspension for loose soil, soften for rocks
            stiffness = calculate_impedance(vector.terrain_type)
            wheel.suspension.set_rigidity(stiffness)
            
            # Apply torque adjusted for predicted slip ratio
            wheel.motor.apply_torque(vector.torque_map[wheel.id])
```

## 5. Failure Recovery Modes
1.  **Sand Trap Escape:** Initiates "Peristaltic Motion," wiggling the chassis segments to fluidize surrounding sand and float the main body to the surface.
2.  **Cliff Detection:** Deploys micro-anchors capable of holding the rover on a 75-degree incline if a sudden drop-off is detected.
3.  **Sensor Blindness:** Switches to "Tactile Whisker" navigation using extendable probes to physically feel the path forward in zero-visibility dust storms or deep shadow craters.

## 6. Applications
*   **Titan Surface Exploration:** Navigating liquid methane shorelines where the boundary between land and liquid is indistinct.
*   **Europa Sub-surface Ocean:** Inverted ice traversal for submersible rovers attached to the ice crust.
*   **Active Volcanic Rims:** Adapting to lava tubes and shifting igneous rock plates on Io.

## 7. Development Status
*   **TRL (Technology Readiness Level):** 4
*   **Next Milestone:** Vacuum chamber testing with simulants for Mars Phobos dust (ultra-low gravity adhesion testing).
