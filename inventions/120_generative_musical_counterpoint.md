**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Composition of Musical Counterpoint

**Abstract:**
A system for music composition is disclosed. A user provides a primary musical melody line. The system sends this melody to a generative AI model that is trained on the rules of classical music theory, specifically the principles of counterpoint. The AI generates one or more new melodic lines that are harmonically and rhythmically complementary to the original melody, creating a complete polyphonic piece.

**Detailed Description:**
A composer inputs a single melody into a music editor. They select the melody and invoke the "AI Counterpoint" feature. The system prompts an AI: `You are J.S. Bach. Given the following cantus firmus, compose a first-species counterpoint melody above it.` The AI, understanding the strict rules of this style, generates a new melodic line that is musically correct and aesthetically pleasing. The new line is added as a new track in the editor.

**Claims:**
1. A method for music composition, comprising:
   a. Receiving a primary melody from a user.
   b. Providing the melody to a generative AI model trained on music theory.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a second, complementary melody that follows the rules of counterpoint.
   d. Presenting the combined melodies to the user.
