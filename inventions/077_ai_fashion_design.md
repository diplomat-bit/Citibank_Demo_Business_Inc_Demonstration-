**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Generative Fashion Design

**Abstract:**
A system for fashion design is disclosed. A user provides a natural language prompt describing a clothing item, including style, material, and theme (e.g., "a streetwear hoodie inspired by brutalist architecture"). A generative AI image model creates a set of design sketches or photorealistic mockups of the described garment.

**Detailed Description:**
A fashion designer uses the tool for inspiration. They enter a prompt. The system calls an image generation model like Imagen. The AI generates several design options, which the designer can then use as a starting point for their collection.

**Claims:**
1. A method for fashion design, comprising:
   a. Receiving a natural language description of a garment.
   b. Transmitting the description to a generative AI image model.
   c. Displaying the generated images of the garment to a user.
