**Title of Invention:** System and Method for AI-Driven Investment Portfolio Construction

**Abstract:**
A system for generating a personalized investment portfolio is disclosed. A user provides their financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. This information is sent to a generative AI model prompted to act as an investment advisor. The AI analyzes the user's profile and, using its knowledge of financial principles, generates a recommended asset allocation and a specific, diversified portfolio of securities (e.g., stocks, ETFs) designed to meet the user's objectives.

**Background of the Invention:**
Constructing a well-diversified investment portfolio that aligns with an individual's specific goals and risk tolerance requires significant financial expertise. While robo-advisors exist, they often use rigid, template-based models. There is a need for a more dynamic system that can generate truly bespoke portfolios based on a nuanced, conversational understanding of a user's needs.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
A user completes a short questionnaire about their investment goals. The system sends this data to an LLM with a prompt: `You are a fiduciary investment advisor. A client has a 'High Growth' risk tolerance and a 10-year investment horizon. Their goal is to maximize long-term returns. Generate a sample portfolio allocation across asset classes (Equities, Bonds, Alternatives) and suggest 5 specific ETFs that would form a good core for this portfolio.` The AI's structured response is then used to populate a "Recommended Portfolio" view for the user.

**Claims:**
1. A method for constructing an investment portfolio, comprising:
   a. Receiving a user's financial goals and risk tolerance.
   b. Transmitting this information to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a recommended asset allocation and a list of specific securities.
   d. Displaying the generated portfolio to the user.
