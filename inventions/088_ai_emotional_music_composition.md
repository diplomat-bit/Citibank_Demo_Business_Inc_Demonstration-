**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Music Composition from Emotional Descriptors

**Abstract:**
A system for automated music generation is disclosed. The system receives a natural language prompt from a user describing a mood, emotion, or scene (e.g., "a melancholic but hopeful piano piece for a rainy day"). This prompt is sent to a generative AI model trained on music theory and a vast corpus of musical works. The AI generates a novel, royalty-free musical composition in a standard format (e.g., MIDI or MP3) that embodies the user's specified emotional intent.

**Background of the Invention:**
Music composition is a highly specialized skill requiring artistic talent and deep knowledge of music theory. Creating custom music for projects like films, games, or marketing content is often expensive and involves complex licensing. While algorithmic music generation exists, it often produces generic or emotionally flat results. There is a need for a tool that can generate high-quality, emotionally resonant music from simple, intuitive, and descriptive user prompts.

**Brief Summary of the Invention:**
The present invention provides an AI-powered music composer. A user provides a natural language prompt describing the desired mood, style, or emotion of a piece of music. The system sends this prompt to a generative AI model specifically trained for music generation. The AI interprets the emotional and thematic content of the prompt and composes a new, original piece of music, which is then delivered to the user as a standard audio file. This enables non-musicians to create custom soundtracks tailored to their creative vision.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
A user enters a prompt into the "AI Composer" interface. The system constructs a detailed prompt for a model like Google's MusicLM. The prompt includes the user's description as well as technical parameters (e.g., desired length, instrumentation). The AI generates the audio data, which is then presented to the user with playback controls and a download link.

**Claims:**
1. A method for music composition, comprising:
   a. Receiving a natural language prompt describing a desired emotion or mood.
   b. Transmitting the prompt to a generative AI music model.
   c. Receiving a generated musical composition in a digital audio format from the model.
   d. Providing the audio to the user.
