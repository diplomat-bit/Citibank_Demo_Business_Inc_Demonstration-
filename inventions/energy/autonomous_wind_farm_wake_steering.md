# Autonomous Cooperative Wake Steering (ACWS)

### Category: Renewable Energy / Smart Grid / Cyber-Physical Systems

## 1. Problem Statement
In dense wind farm arrays, turbines traditionally operate "greedily," orienting themselves directly into the wind to maximize individual power generation. This creates an aerodynamic shadow known as a "wake"—a cone of turbulent, slow-moving air trailing downstream. Turbines located in these wakes suffer from the **Wake Effect**, resulting in:
1.  **Power Loss:** Downstream turbines generate 10-20% less energy due to reduced wind velocity.
2.  **Structural Fatigue:** The high turbulence intensity inside a wake creates uneven loading on downstream blades and gearboxes, shortening asset lifespan.

## 2. Invention Description
The **ACWS** is a decentralized, multi-agent control system that dynamically optimizes the yaw angles of every turbine in a farm to maximize *aggregate* power output rather than individual efficiency. By intentionally misaligning upstream turbines relative to the wind (yawing), the system steers the wake deflection path away from downstream rotors.

This system moves beyond static lookup tables by employing **Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to adapt to complex, time-varying atmospheric conditions in real-time.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### A. Sensor Suite (Per Turbine)
*   **Nacelle-Mounted LiDAR:** Forward-facing pulsed laser Doppler systems to measure inflow wind speed, direction, and shear profile 200m ahead of the rotor.
*   **Strain Gauges:** Root blade sensors to detect real-time turbulence loading and fatigue accumulation.

### B. The "Swarm" Neural Network
The control logic is built on a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** architecture:
*   **Nodes:** Individual turbines.
*   **Edges:** Dynamic aerodynamic relationships (which change based on wind direction).

**Algorithm:**
The system uses a **Cooperative Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** approach.
1.  **Global Reward Function:** $J = \sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i(u_i) - \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathcal{L}_{fatigue, i}$
    *   Where $P_i$ is the power of turbine $i$, and $\mathcal{L}$ is the mechanical load.
2.  **Action Space:** Continuous yaw offset control $\gamma \in [-25^\circ, +25^\circ]$.

### C. Operational Logic
1.  **Detection:** Turbine A (upstream) detects wind vector $\vec{v}$.
2.  **Prediction:** The physics-informed ML model predicts that at the current angle, Turbine A's wake will envelop Turbine B (downstream).
3.  **Actuation:** Turbine A intentionally yaws $15^\circ$ off-axis.
    *   *Result A:* Turbine A loses ~4% efficiency ($cos^p(\gamma)$ loss).
    *   *Result B:* The wake is steered laterally by 100 meters, bypassing Turbine B.
    *   *Result C:* Turbine B sees free-stream velocity, gaining ~30% efficiency.
4.  **Net Outcome:** The combined output of A+B increases significantly.

## 4. Key Innovations
*   **Physics-Informed Machine Learning:** The neural network is pre-trained on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations (Large Eddy Simulations) to understand fluid mechanics before deployment.
*   **Dynamic Topology:** The "neighbor" relationship between turbines updates dynamically. If the wind shifts 90 degrees, the "upstream" and "downstream" roles swap instantly in the control graph.
*   **Fatigue Balancing:** The system can rotate the role of "wake steerer" among turbines to ensure no single unit bears excessive side-loading fatigue from prolonged yaw misalignment.

## 5. Viability and Impact
*   **Efficiency Gain:** Simulations suggest a **5-12% increase within annual energy production (AEP)** for offshore wind farms.
*   **Retrofit Potential:** This is primarily a software-defined invention. While LiDAR improves accuracy, the core logic can be deployed on existing wind farm SCADA systems using current anemometer data.
*   **Land Use:** Allows for tighter spacing of turbines, increasing the energy density per square kilometer of leased land or seabed.
