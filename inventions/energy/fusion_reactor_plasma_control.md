# Invention: Plasma-Stabilized Fusion Reactor Control Agent (PSFR-CA)

## Invention Category: Energy / Fusion Reactor Control

## Invention Description:
The Plasma-Stabilized Fusion Reactor Control Agent (PSFR-CA) is a novel, fully autonomous Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system designed to maintain stable plasma confinement within magnetic confinement fusion devices (tokamaks and stellarators). Unlike traditional PID controllers or pre-programmed magnetic field adjustments, PSFR-CA learns complex, non-linear control policies directly from real-time diagnostic data, predicting and preempting plasma instabilities (such as Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) and major disruptions) milliseconds before they become critical.

The agent utilizes a large-scale Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) architecture, trained initially in high-fidelity simulation environments (digital twins) that incorporate complex magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) physics models. The agent’s state space includes thousands of diagnostic inputs (electron temperature/density profiles, magnetic field sensor arrays, divertor heat flux, turbulence measurements). Its action space involves precise, high-frequency modulation of numerous individual magnetic coil currents across various poloidal and toroidal systems.

## Key Innovations Over Existing Technology:

1.  **Predictive Disruption Avoidance:** PSFR-CA goes beyond reactive stabilization. It learns to recognize the subtle, emergent precursors to macroscopic instabilities in the high-dimensional state space, allowing for corrective magnetic pulses that steer the plasma away from the disruption threshold hours or minutes before conventional systems detect an imminent failure.
2.  **Self-Optimizing Confinement Metrics:** The DRL reward function is engineered not just to prevent shutdowns, but to simultaneously maximize confinement time ($\tau_E$) while maintaining favorable operational parameters (e.g., minimizing neutron flux peaks or maximizing triple product). The agent continuously tunes the magnetic configuration (shaping, shear, rotational transform) for optimal performance under varying fuel injection rates and heating power.
3.  **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** The DRL policy is decoupled from specific hardware jitter and latency via a learned predictive compensation model within the HAL, enabling robust deployment across different physical reactor designs without extensive re-tuning.
4.  **Anomaly Detection Integration:** The control agent is cross-validated against a secondary unsupervised learning module that flags control actions taken by the DRL agent that fall outside expected physical boundaries, providing a built-in safety governor that triggers failsafe shutdown procedures if the DRL policy enters an unknown or potentially destructive state.

## Advantages Over Input Technology (General Plasma Control):

*   **Speed and Complexity Handling:** Traditional controllers struggle with the enormous dimensionality and time scale separations inherent in fusion plasma dynamics. PSFR-CA handles millions of floating-point operations per second to calculate optimal control vectors instantly.
*   **Adaptability:** The agent adapts autonomously to plasma contamination, wall erosion effects, and unexpected impurity influxes, maintaining stability where pre-programmed algorithms would require manual recalibration.
*   **Performance Ceiling:** The DRL agent consistently achieves plasma performance metrics (e.g., density limits, beta limits) demonstrably higher than those achieved by human operators or legacy rule-based control systems.

## Potential Impact:
Accelerates the realization of practical, sustained fusion energy by dramatically increasing the operational uptime and reliability of demonstration reactors (DEMO) by eliminating catastrophic downtime caused by plasma disruptions.
