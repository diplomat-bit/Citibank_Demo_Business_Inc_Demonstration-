**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Generating Marketing Copy from Product Descriptions

**Abstract:**
A system for generating marketing and advertising copy is disclosed. The system receives a textual description of a product or service. This description is used as the basis for a prompt sent to a generative AI model. The prompt instructs the model to create a plurality of marketing assets, such as short, punchy headlines or longer-form ad copy, based on the key features and benefits outlined in the product description. This automates a key part of the marketing process, allowing users to quickly generate a variety of creative options for their campaigns.

**Background of the Invention:**
Writing effective advertising copy is a specialized skill that requires creativity and an understanding of marketing principles. Business owners and marketers often spend significant time and resources developing compelling copy. There is a need for a tool that can assist in this creative process, rapidly generating a variety of high-quality copy options based on a simple product description.

**Brief Summary of the Invention:**
The present invention provides a user interface where a user can input a description of their product or service. When triggered, the system sends this description to a large language model (LLM) like Gemini. The prompt instructs the LLM to act as an expert copywriter and generate specific marketing assets, such as "three short headlines for a social media ad." The text generated by the model is then returned and displayed to the user, who can then use, edit, or regenerate the copy for their marketing campaigns.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
A user interacts with a Marketing Automation module within a software application. The interface contains a text input field where the user enters a description of a product, for instance, "Our new AI-powered savings tool that automatically analyzes spending and finds savings."

The user can then trigger the AI copy generation. The frontend application sends the product description to a backend service. The backend service constructs a prompt for a generative AI model. The prompt might be, `Write 3 short, punchy ad copy headlines for this product: "Our new AI-powered savings tool that automatically analyzes spending and finds savings."`

The backend service receives the text response from the AI model, which might contain a list of headlines. This response is forwarded to the client application, which then displays the generated headlines in the user interface. The user can review the copy, select the best option, or modify the product description to generate different results.

**Claims:**
1. A method for generating advertising copy, comprising:
   a. Receiving a text description of a product or service from a user.
   b. Constructing a prompt for a generative AI model that includes the user-provided text description and an instruction to create advertising copy.
   c. Transmitting the prompt to the generative AI model.
   d. Receiving a text response from the model containing the generated advertising copy.
   e. Displaying the generated advertising copy to the user.

2. The method of claim 1, wherein the instruction specifies the type of advertising copy to be created, such as a headline, a body paragraph, or a call-to-action.

3. The method of claim 1, wherein the prompt instructs the AI model to generate a plurality of distinct copy options.
