**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for AI-Powered Wildfire Behavior Prediction

**Abstract:**
A system for predicting the spread of wildfires is disclosed. The system ingests real-time data, including satellite imagery of the fire's current perimeter, topographical data, vegetation type, and meteorological data (wind speed, humidity). This multi-modal data is fed to a generative AI model, which acts as an expert fire behavior analyst. The AI generates a probabilistic map forecasting the fire's likely spread over the next 12, 24, and 48 hours, allowing firefighters to more effectively allocate resources and plan evacuations.

**Detailed Description:**
The system receives the current fire map and weather forecast. It prompts a specialized AI: `Given the current fire perimeter, a 20 mph wind from the NNW, and a landscape of dry chaparral, predict the fire's spread over the next 12 hours.` The AI generates a new map layer showing the areas with the highest probability of burning, highlighting communities at risk.

**Claims:**
1. A method for wildfire prediction, comprising:
   a. Ingesting real-time data about a fire's location, weather, and fuel type.
   b. Providing this data to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a forecast of the fire's
