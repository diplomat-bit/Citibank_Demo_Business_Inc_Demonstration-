**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for AI-Assisted Veterinary Diagnosis

**Abstract:**
A system for assisting veterinarians is disclosed. A vet inputs a set of an animal's symptoms, breed, age, and any available lab results. The system sends this information to a generative AI model trained on a massive corpus of veterinary medical literature, case studies, and textbooks. The AI generates a list of potential differential diagnoses, ranked by probability. For each potential diagnosis, it lists the typical follow-up tests or questions the vet should ask to confirm, acting as a powerful diagnostic second opinion.

**Detailed Description:**
A vet enters: `Dog, Golden Retriever, 8 years old. Symptoms: lethargy, loss of appetite, pale gums.` The AI is prompted to provide a differential diagnosis. It returns a ranked list: `1. Hemangiosarcoma (High Probability), 2. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (Medium Probability), 3. Toxin Ingestion (Low Probability). Recommended immediate next step: Abdominal ultrasound to check for splenic tumors.`

**Claims:**
1. A method for veterinary diagnostic assistance, comprising:
   a. Receiving an animal's symptoms and medical data.
   b. Providing this information to a generative AI model trained on veterinary medicine.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a ranked list of potential diagnoses and suggested next steps.
   d. Displaying the list to a qualified veterinary professional.
