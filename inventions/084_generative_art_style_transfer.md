**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Artistic Style Transfer

**Abstract:**
A system for image editing is disclosed. A user provides a "content" image and a "style" image. The system sends both images to a multi-modal generative AI model. The AI is prompted to redraw the content image in the artistic style of the style image. This allows for the creation of novel artworks by combining the subject of one image with the aesthetic of another.

**Detailed Description:**
A user uploads a photo of their dog and an image of a Van Gogh painting. The system sends both to an image editing AI. **Prompt:** `Apply the style of the second image to the first image.` The AI returns a new image of the dog, painted in the style of Van Gogh.

**Claims:**
1. A method for image creation, comprising:
   a. Receiving a content image and a style image.
   b. Transmitting both images to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a new image that combines the content of the first image with the artistic style of the second.
