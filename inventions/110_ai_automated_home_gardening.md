**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for AI-Powered Automated Home Gardening

**Abstract:**
A system for automated indoor gardening is disclosed. The system combines sensors (for soil moisture, pH, light levels) with a generative AI model. The AI has a database of plant care requirements. Based on the specific plant being grown and the real-time sensor data, the AI autonomously controls actuators for watering, nutrient dispensing, and adjusting grow lights to create the optimal environment. The AI can also use a camera to visually monitor the plant for signs of disease or stress and provide a diagnosis and treatment plan.

**Detailed Description:**
A user has an automated hydroponic system. They tell the system they are growing "tomatoes." The system's AI, knowing the optimal conditions for tomatoes, continuously monitors the sensor data. If the moisture level drops, it activates the water pump. If it detects via camera that the leaves are yellowing, it cross-references this visual data with the nutrient sensor readings and concludes there is a magnesium deficiency. It then prompts the user to add a specific nutrient solution, or if the system is fully automated, it dispenses the solution itself.

**Claims:**
1. A method for automated gardening, comprising:
   a. Monitoring a plant's environment using a plurality of sensors.
   b. Using a camera to visually monitor the plant's health.
   c. Providing the sensor and visual data to a generative AI model that has knowledge of the plant's specific needs.
   d. Prompting the model to determine if any intervention is needed.
   e. Autonomously controlling one or more actuators (e.g., water pump, light) based on the model's determination.
