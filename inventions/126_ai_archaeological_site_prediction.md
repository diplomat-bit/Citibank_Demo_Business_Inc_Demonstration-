**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Predicting the Location of Undiscovered Archaeological Sites

**Abstract:**
A system for archaeological research is disclosed. The system ingests a vast amount of geospatial data, including satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, historical maps, and soil composition data. It also includes the locations of known archaeological sites. An AI model is trained to identify the unique environmental and topographical signatures of these known sites. The model then scans new, unexplored regions to find areas that match these signatures, generating a probability map of where undiscovered sites are most likely to be located.

**Detailed Description:**
Researchers feed the system data for a region, including the locations of all known Roman villas. The AI learns that these villas are typically located on south-facing slopes, within 2km of a freshwater source, and have a specific type of soil. The AI then analyzes a new, unexcavated valley and highlights three specific locations that match this learned pattern with over 90% confidence, guiding the archaeologists to where they should dig first.

**Claims:**
1. A method for archaeological prediction, comprising:
   a. Training a generative AI model on the geographic and environmental characteristics of known archaeological sites.
   b. Providing the model with geospatial data for an unexplored region.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a probability map highlighting areas with a high likelihood of containing undiscovered sites.
