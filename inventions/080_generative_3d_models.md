**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Generating 3D Models from Text or Images

**Abstract:**
A system for 3D model creation is disclosed. A user provides a description or an image of an object. This input is sent to a generative AI model specifically trained to produce 3D assets. The model generates a 3D model file (e.g., in .obj or .glb format) that represents the object described in the input. This allows for the rapid creation of 3D assets for gaming, simulation, or design without manual 3D modeling.

**Detailed Description:**
A game developer needs a "weathered wooden treasure chest." They type this prompt into the system. The system calls a specialized 3D generative model. The model returns a `.glb` file, which can be immediately imported into the game engine.

**Claims:**
1. A method for creating a 3D model, comprising:
   a. Receiving a text or image description of an object.
   b. Transmitting the description to a generative AI model trained for 3D asset generation.
   c. Receiving a 3D model file from the AI.
