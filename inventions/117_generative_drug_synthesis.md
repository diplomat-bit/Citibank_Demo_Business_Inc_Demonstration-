**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Generative Design of Novel Drug Synthesis Pathways

**Abstract:**
A system for accelerating pharmaceutical development is disclosed. A chemist provides a target molecular structure for a drug. A generative AI model, trained on a massive database of chemical reactions and organic chemistry principles, designs one or more novel, efficient synthesis pathways to create the target molecule from commercially available starting materials. The system evaluates the generated pathways for yield, cost, and safety, providing chemists with a set of viable manufacturing routes.

**Detailed Description:**
A pharmaceutical chemist inputs the SMILES string for a new drug candidate. The system prompts an AI: `Generate three distinct, high-yield chemical synthesis pathways for the molecule [SMILES string]. Start from commercially available reagents.` The AI, acting as an expert organic chemist, returns three different step-by-step reaction plans, which can then be validated in the lab.

**Claims:**
1. A method for chemical synthesis planning, comprising:
   a. Receiving a target molecular structure.
   b. Providing the structure to a generative AI model trained on chemical reaction data.
   c. Prompting the model to generate one or more multi-step synthesis pathways to produce the target molecule.
   d. Presenting the generated pathways to a user.
