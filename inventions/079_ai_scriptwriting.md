**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Collaborative Scriptwriting with a Generative AI

**Abstract:**
A system for creative writing is disclosed. A writer provides a scene description or a piece of dialogue. They can then prompt a generative AI model to provide suggestions for what happens next, write a line of dialogue for a specific character, or describe a character's actions. The AI acts as a co-writer or "brainstorming partner," helping the writer overcome creative blocks and explore new narrative possibilities.

**Detailed Description:**
A writer is working in a script editor. They are stuck. They highlight a character's name and prompt the integrated AI: "Suggest a witty reply for this character." The AI generates a few options for the next line of dialogue, which the writer can then use or edit.

**Claims:**
1. A method for assisting in creative writing, comprising:
   a. Providing an interface for writing a script.
   b. Allowing a user to select a portion of the script and provide a prompt to a generative AI.
   c. Receiving a generated text suggestion from the AI relevant to the prompt.
   d. Allowing the user to incorporate the suggestion into their script.
