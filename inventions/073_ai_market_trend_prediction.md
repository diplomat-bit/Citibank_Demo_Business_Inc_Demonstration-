**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Market Trend Prediction from Alternative Data

**Abstract:**
A system for financial market analysis is disclosed. The system ingests a wide range of alternative, unstructured data, such as social media sentiment, satellite imagery of parking lots, and supply chain shipping data. A generative AI model is prompted to synthesize these disparate data sources and generate a qualitative forecast for a specific company or sector, along with a rationale based on the provided data.

**Detailed Description:**
A daily job gathers alternative data. It prompts an LLM: `You are a hedge fund analyst. Based on this data (social sentiment is dropping, satellite data shows fewer cars at stores), what is your forecast for the retail sector's next earnings season?` The AI's narrative forecast is then presented to human analysts.

**Claims:**
1. A method for market analysis, comprising:
   a. Ingesting data from a plurality of alternative data sources.
   b. Providing the data to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a qualitative forecast for a market sector.
   d. Displaying the forecast to a user.
