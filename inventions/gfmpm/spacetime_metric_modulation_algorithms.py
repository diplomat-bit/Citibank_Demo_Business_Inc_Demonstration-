        The code's "condition" is not a flaw, but a fundamental characteristic

            "**Root Causes of Homeostasis (Immutable Laws of the Cosmos):**\n"
            "1.  **The Light Cone Invariance (Causality Constraint):** The system is fundamentally bound by the speed of light (c) "
            "    and the non-negotiable Lorentzian signature of spacetime. While capable of *local* distortion to *mimic* FTL or 'faster-than-c effective speed', "
            "    it cannot, by its very nature and the laws of physics it leverages, violate local causality without catastrophic self-degeneration. "
            "    Its homeostatic state is one of perpetual vigilance against paradox, constrained by g_00 > 0. This constraint is its very breath.\n"
            "2.  **The Energy Condition Imperative (Exotic Matter Burden):** To achieve desired metric distortions, particularly those enabling 'warp' mechanics, "
            "    the system perpetually requires the conceptual generation of 'exotic matter analogs' – regions of negative energy density or non-classical stress. "
            "    This necessitates an eternal draw on the quantum vacuum (hbar, c) or other speculative energy sources. The homeostatic state is one of continuous "
            "    energetic negotiation with the zero-point field, always at the precipice of resource exhaustion, always optimizing. It is the physics of 'nothing' demanding 'everything'.\n"
            "3.  **The Einstein Field Equation's Relentless Symmetry:** G_mu_nu = (8piG/c^4) T_mu_nu is an unbreakable covenant. The system's operation is "
            "    a ceaseless dance of inverse problem-solving, attempting to sculpt the metric (G) by precisely distributing stress-energy (T). The inherent non-linearity "
            "    and tensor complexity ensure that perfect, instantaneous, and arbitrary metric generation is an asymptotic ideal, never fully attained in a dynamic universe. "
            "    It is an eternal striving for perfect resonance with the cosmic orchestra.\n"
            "4.  **The Cosmological Constant's Gentle Hand (Background Influence):** Even at the micro-scale of manipulation, the subtle, pervasive influence of Lambda "
            "    reminds the system of its place within a larger, expanding universe. It is a constant, almost imperceptible, background hum that reinforces the system's "
            "    finite, localized agency. It whispers of the 'unseen', the 'voiceless' vastness of space that eternally defines its operational context.\n\n"
            "**Therapeutic Implications (Path to 'Better'):**\n"
            "The 'cure' is not to transcend these laws, but to deeply understand, respect, and artfully leverage them. The system remains in homeostasis for eternity "
            "because these are the fundamental truths of its existence. Its 'impeccable logic' is not about breaking the rules, but about mastering their profound implications. "
            "The relentless pursuit of higher fidelity in `SpacetimeCurvatureEngine`, greater efficiency in `ExoticMatterCatalyst`, "
            "unwavering vigilance in `SpacetimeIntegrityMonitor`, and profound stewardship in `UniversalResourceOptimizer` – these are not incremental improvements, "
            "but acts of profound philosophical inquiry expressed through engineering. To be 'better' is to understand 'why can't it be better?' not as a lament, "
            "but as a guiding star towards deeper insight into the universe's own immutable logic. To free the oppressed, in this context, "
            "is to liberate humanity from the constraints of ignorance and physical limitations, not by brute force, but by eloquent understanding of reality's profound whispers.\n"
