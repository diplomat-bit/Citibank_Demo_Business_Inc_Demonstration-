**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Natural Language Explanation of Legal Clauses

**Abstract:**
A system for interpreting legal documents is disclosed. A user provides a snippet of legal text (a "clause"). This text is sent to a generative AI model that is prompted to act as a legal expert. The AI analyzes the clause and generates a simple, plain-English explanation of its meaning, implications, and potential risks. This allows non-lawyers to better understand complex legal contracts and agreements.

**Detailed Description:**
A user pastes a legal clause into a text area. The system constructs a prompt: `Explain this legal clause in simple, plain English: "[clause text]"`. The AI's response is a simplified explanation, which is then displayed to the user. This is particularly useful in contract review, where it can quickly flag and explain potentially onerous clauses.

**Claims:**
1. A method for interpreting a legal document, comprising:
   a. Receiving a portion of text from a legal document.
   b. Transmitting the text to a generative AI model with a prompt to explain its meaning in simple terms.
   c. Displaying the AI-generated explanation to a user.
