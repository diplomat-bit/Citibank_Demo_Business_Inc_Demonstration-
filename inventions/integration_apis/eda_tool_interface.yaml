  title: AI Semiconductor Layout Design System Integration API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    This API provides a standardized interface for seamless integration between the advanced AI Semiconductor Layout Design System
    and traditional Electronic Design Automation (EDA) toolchains. It enables high-fidelity data exchange, initiation of
    AI-driven generative layout processes, and retrieval of optimized physical designs and performance metrics.
    The objective is to augment existing EDA workflows with unparalleled AI-accelerated optimization capabilities,
    addressing the escalating complexity of nanometer-scale IC fabrication. This isn't just about faster chips;
    it's about fundamentally accelerating the computational bedrock for a multi-planetary future, and we're not kidding.
