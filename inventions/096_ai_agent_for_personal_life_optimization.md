**Title of Invention:** An AI Agent for Holistic Personal Life Optimization

**Abstract:**
An autonomous AI agent for personal productivity is disclosed. The user grants the agent access to their personal data streams: calendar, email, fitness tracker, and financial accounts. The agent's goal is to optimize the user's life according to their stated priorities (e.g., "health," "career growth"). The agent can take autonomous actions, such as scheduling gym sessions, blocking focus time in the calendar, summarizing important emails, and alerting the user to goal-misaligned spending.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
This system combines multiple AI functions. It uses an AI scheduler to optimize the calendar, an AI summarizer for emails, and an AI financial analyst for spending. A central "Master AI" prompts these sub-agents and synthesizes their outputs to make holistic decisions, acting as a true digital chief of staff for the user's life.

**Claims:**
1. A method for personal optimization, comprising:
   a. An AI agent accessing a plurality of a user's personal data streams.
   b. The agent analyzing the data in the context of the user's stated life goals.
   c. The agent autonomously taking actions, such as scheduling calendar events, to better align the user's time and resources with their goals.
