**Title of Invention:** A System and Method for Automated Generation of Code Vulnerability Patches

**Abstract:**
A system for automated software security is disclosed. The system scans a codebase and identifies a specific security vulnerability (e.g., a SQL injection vulnerability). It provides the vulnerable code snippet and a description of the vulnerability type to a generative AI model. The AI is prompted to act as a security engineer and rewrite the code to patch the vulnerability. The system can then automatically create a pull request with the AI-generated fix.

**Detailed Description:**
A security scanner finds a vulnerability. An automated workflow prompts an LLM: `This Python code is vulnerable to SQL injection. Rewrite it to use parameterized queries. Code: [vulnerable code].` The AI returns the patched code. The system creates a new git branch, applies the change, and opens a pull request for a human developer to review and merge.

**Claims:**
1. A method for fixing a code vulnerability, comprising:
   a. Identifying a vulnerable snippet of source code.
   b. Providing the code and a description of the vulnerability to a generative AI.
   c. Receiving a patched version of the code from the AI.
   d. Submitting the patched code for review.
