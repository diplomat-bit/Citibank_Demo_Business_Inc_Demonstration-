**Title of Invention:** System and Method for Generating Recipes from a List of Ingredients

**Abstract:**
A system for recipe generation is disclosed. A user provides a list of ingredients they have available. This list is sent to a generative AI model, which is prompted to act as a creative chef. The AI generates one or more recipes that can be made using primarily the provided ingredients, including step-by-step cooking instructions.

**Detailed Description:**
A user inputs "chicken breast, rice, broccoli, soy sauce." The system prompts an LLM: `You are a chef. Create a simple recipe using these ingredients: [ingredients list].` The AI returns a formatted recipe for "Simple Chicken and Broccoli Stir-fry."

**Claims:**
1. A method for recipe generation, comprising:
   a. Receiving a list of ingredients from a user.
   b. Transmitting the list to a generative AI model.
   c. Prompting the model to generate a recipe using said ingredients.
   d. Displaying the recipe to the user.
