**Title of Invention:** An Autonomous AI Agent for Scientific Hypothesis Generation and Experimentation

**Abstract:**
An autonomous AI agent for conducting scientific research is disclosed. The agent is provided with access to a large corpus of scientific papers and a high-level research goal. The agent autonomously reads the literature, formulates novel hypotheses, designs experiments to test them (initially in simulation), and writes a summary of its findings. It operates in a continuous loop of hypothesis, experiment, and learning.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**
The agent is given a goal, e.g., "Find novel material compositions for improved battery performance."
1. **Research:** The agent performs semantic searches on ArXiv and other databases to understand the current state of the art.
2. **Hypothesize:** The agent prompts an LLM with its findings to generate new, untested hypotheses.
3. **Experiment:** The agent uses an AI-powered simulation environment to test the properties of the new hypothetical materials.
4. **Report:** The agent writes a paper summarizing its methodology, results, and conclusions, identifying the most promising material for further physical testing.

**Claims:**
1. A method for autonomous scientific research, comprising:
   a. An AI agent programmatically reading a corpus of scientific literature.
   b. The agent using a generative AI to formulate a novel hypothesis.
   c. The agent designing and executing a simulated experiment to test the hypothesis.
   d. The agent summarizing the results of the experiment.
