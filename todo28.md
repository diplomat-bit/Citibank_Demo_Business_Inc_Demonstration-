# Go-Live Strategy, Phase VIII
## Tending the Garden, Reaching New Shores

### I. Mission Directive
To evolve the Demo Bank architecture from a system capable of serving our first community to a globally distributed platform capable of welcoming millions. This phase is a mindful investment in healthy scaling, reliability, and international friendship, preparing our garden to flourish worldwide.

### II. Key Strategic Objectives
1.  **Architectural Nurturing:**
    -   **Database Sharding:** Gently partition our core database to allow it to grow horizontally, like creating new garden beds so roots have room to spread.
    -   **Cell-Based Architecture:** Decompose our system into smaller, independent "cells." This ensures that if one part of the garden has a problem, it doesn't affect the others.
    -   **Asynchronous Workflows:** Shift more operations to run in the background using our event bus (Kafka), making the app feel more responsive and resilient.
2.  **Global Infrastructure Rollout:**
    -   Establish a presence in at least two new cloud regions (e.g., Europe and Asia) to make our service faster and more responsive for our international friends.
    -   Implement a global CDN (like Cloudflare or Fastly) to make our app feel quick and light for everyone, everywhere.
    -   Deploy a global database solution (like Google Spanner or CockroachDB) for data that needs to be accessed quickly from anywhere in the world.
3.  **Internationalization (i18n) & Localization (l10n):**
    -   Refactor our entire frontend to speak multiple languages, pulling all text from a centralized localization platform (like Lokalise).
    -   Build the **Localization Platform** module to help us manage translations collaboratively.
4.  **Community Expansion:**
    -   Establish our first two international community hubs: London (for EMEA) and Singapore (for APAC).

### III. Technical & Operational Plan
-   **Scaling Guild:** Create a dedicated, cross-functional team of our most experienced engineers to guide the sharding and cell-based architecture projects. This is a journey that requires our most thoughtful navigators.
-   **Data Residency:** Implement the architecture needed to allow users to store their data in their home region, respecting their data sovereignty and privacy regulations like GDPR.
-   **Global On-Call:** Expand our on-call rotation to a follow-the-sun model, with engineers in each major region (US, EMEA, APAC) to ensure someone is always awake and available to help.
-   **Currency & Payments:** Integrate with international payment gateways and build the core logic for the **Multi-Currency** and **Cross-Border Payments** modules, making finance feel borderless.

### IV. Team Expansion (+50 FTEs)
-   **US Engineering (20):**
    -   +10 Senior/Principal Engineers for the Scaling Guild.
    -   +10 SREs and Backend Engineers to tend to our growing infrastructure.
-   **EMEA Hub - London (15):**
    -   1 General Manager, EMEA
    -   5 Community & Marketing
    -   5 Engineers
    -   4 Support & Operations
-   **APAC Hub - Singapore (15):**
    -   1 General Manager, APAC
    -   5 Community & Marketing
    -   5 Engineers
    -   4 Support & Operations
