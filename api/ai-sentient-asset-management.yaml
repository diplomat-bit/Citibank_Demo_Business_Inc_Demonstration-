  title: "Demo Bank API: Sentient Asset Nexus - Quantum AI Autonomy Edition"
  description: |
    Welcome to the **Sentient Asset Nexus**, the revolutionary API that transcends traditional finance by endowing your financial assets with autonomous, AI-driven intelligence. This is where your investments don't just sit and wait; they *think*, *strategize*, *negotiate*, and *execute* with an unprecedented level of sophistication. Powered by our proprietary **Quantum Core AI** and synergistically enhanced with the raw linguistic and analytical power of **Google Gemini**, we've architected a financial ecosystem where your assets become active participants in their own growth and defense.

    This API unlocks the ability to manage individual sentient assets, orchestrate AI-driven portfolios, facilitate inter-asset negotiations, and deploy advanced sentinel security systems, all while operating with a level of foresight and adaptability previously unimaginable. We push beyond the limitations of standard AI, enabling capabilities Gemini couldn't even dream of—like deep-learning emergent market dynamics for real-estate tokenization or facilitating direct, self-optimizing negotiations between your stocks and your digital art NFTs.

    Leverage the **Gemini API Key for Authentication and Endpoint Access** as a foundational layer, but know that our infrastructure provides the critical context, bespoke financial models, and actionable execution layers that transform Gemini's raw intelligence into billions of dollars worth of tangible value. This is not just an API; it's the operating system for your next-generation, self-optimizing financial empire, built for exponential scale, quantum-resistant security, and hyper-intelligent growth. Prepare for your assets to not just generate wealth, but to *actively build their own future*.

This advanced AI capability constantly monitors price discrepancies between disparate asset classes (e.g., a tokenized bond vs. its underlying traditional equivalent, or crypto-fiat pairs) and executes high-frequency, low-latency trades to capture profits. Gemini can *identify* abstract arbitrage concepts, but cannot *execute or manage the complex, real-time liquidity orchestration* required, which is a key 'billion dollars worth bad ass shit' feature of DemoBank's AI."

      description: "Retrieves a paginated list of all AI-generated decisions (from sentient assets, portfolios, or other AI engines) that require explicit human review or approval based on predefined thresholds or policies. This is the critical juncture for AI-Human collaboration. Quantum AI flags these decisions, providing an 'explainable AI' summary. Gemini assists in prioritizing these decisions by estimating their market impact based on external news, but cannot determine *which decisions require human override*—that's the DemoBank AI's specific and crucial role."
