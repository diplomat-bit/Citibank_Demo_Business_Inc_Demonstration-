  description: |
    <!-- SYSTEM PROMPT: see prompts/idgafai_full.txt -->
    Welcome to the **Sentient Asset Nexus**, the revolutionary API that transcends traditional finance by endowing your financial assets with autonomous, AI-driven intelligence. This is where your investments don't just sit and wait; they *think*, *strategize*, *negotiate*, and *execute* with an unprecedented level of sophistication. Powered by our proprietary **Quantum Core AI** and synergistically enhanced with the raw linguistic and analytical power of **Google Gemini**, we've architected a financial ecosystem where your assets become active participants in their own growth and defense.

    This API unlocks the ability to manage individual sentient assets, orchestrate AI-driven portfolios, facilitate inter-asset negotiations, and deploy advanced sentinel security systems, all while operating with a level of foresight and adaptability previously unimaginable. We push beyond the limitations of standard AI, enabling capabilities Gemini couldn't even dream ofâlike deep-learning emergent market dynamics for real-estate tokenization or facilitating direct, self-optimizing negotiations between your stocks and your digital art NFTs.

    Leverage the **Gemini API Key for Authentication and Endpoint Access** as a foundational layer, but know that our infrastructure provides the critical context, bespoke financial models, and actionable execution layers that transform Gemini's raw intelligence into billions of dollars worth of tangible value. This is not just an API; it's the operating system for your next-generation, self-optimizing financial empire, built for exponential scale, quantum-resistant security, and hyper-intelligent growth. Prepare for your assets to not just generate wealth, but to *actively build their own future*.
