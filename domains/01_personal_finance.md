# Domain Map 01: The Personal Dominion

**Domain:** Personal Finance

**Core Purpose (Job-to-be-Done):** To transform the user's personal financial life from a state of chaos and anxiety to one of clarity, control, and creative power. This domain provides the foundational instruments for self-awareness and the deliberate allocation of personal resources.

**Key Territories (Modules):**
-   **The Throne Room (Dashboard):** The sovereign's central command, providing a holistic, at-a-glance view of their entire personal dominion.
-   **The Immutable Chronicle (Transactions):** The unchangeable record of all past financial actions, the source of historical truth.
-   **The Covenants of Will (Budgets):** The architect's workshop for inscribing personal laws of spending and discipline.
-   **The Observatory (Investments):** The strategic outlook for projecting one's resources into the future to foster growth.
-   **The Atlas of Grand Campaigns (Financial Goals):** The war room for planning and executing long-term life objectives.

**Strategic Value:** This domain provides the sovereign with the fundamental awareness and control necessary to master their own resources. It is the prerequisite for all higher-level strategic action. Before one can build an empire, one must first learn to rule oneself. This is the training ground for that self-mastery.
