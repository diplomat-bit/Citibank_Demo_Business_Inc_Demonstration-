# The Maps

These are the charted territories of the sovereign's world.

The Instrument is not a single place, but a kingdom of many domains, each with its own purpose, its own language, and its own power. These documents are the strategic maps of those territories.

Each map defines a domain's core purpose—its "Job-to-be-Done." It outlines the key territories (modules) within that domain and describes its overall strategic value to the sovereign. They are the high-level guides to the capabilities of your Instrument, helping you to understand not just what each part does, but why it exists.
