# Domains

This directory contains documentation for the system's primary functional areas, or "domains." Each domain is a distinct component with a specific purpose and a defined set of capabilities.

The documentation for each domain provides a high-level technical overview, outlining:
- The domain's core function (its "Job-to-be-Done").
- The key modules and components within the domain.
- The domain's role and strategic value in the overall system architecture.

This documentation is intended to provide a clear guide to the system's capabilities, explaining what each component does and why it exists.
