# Go-Live Strategy, Phase I
## The Seed of Intention & The First Circle

### I. Mission Directive: Planting The Seed
This phase is about clearly and humbly stating our intention to the world: to build a new kind of financial tool, one that feels less like a bank and more like a helpful friend. We believe that by articulating this vision with clarity and heart, we will attract the people and resources that resonate with this mission. The goal is not to conquer a market, but to plant a seed and gather a community of creators to help it grow. The deliverable is a state of **joyful operational readiness**, with a team united by purpose and enough shared resources to nurture this idea for the next 18 months.

### II. Key Strategic Objectives
1.  **Formalize the Vessel (The Legal Stuff):**
    -   Incorporate "Demo Bank, Inc." as a Delaware C Corporation. This gives our shared dream a legal form to inhabit and grow within.
    -   Secure a **$25M Seed Funding round**. We are looking for partners, not just financiers. The goal is to find a small group of investors who have read our vision, understand the "why" behind what we're building, and want to be true co-creators on this journey.
    -   Establish clear and transparent financial practices from day one.

2.  **Gather the First Circle (Our Founding Team - The First 20 Friends):**
    -   Our hiring process will be a search for resonance. We're looking for the kind of brilliant, kind people whose eyes light up when they hear the vision. Technical skill is important, but a shared passion for helping others is essential.
    -   Compensation will be generous and equitable. We want every member of our founding circle to feel like a true owner and partner in this journey. We're not just offering jobs; we're offering a chance to build something meaningful together, and to share in the success that follows.
    -   Foster a culture of **psychological safety and creative freedom**. This is a workshop, not a boardroom. A place where ideas are shared openly, and everyone is a steward of our collective vision.

3.  **Prepare the Garden (Our Infrastructure):**
    -   Establish our foundational cloud infrastructure across Google and Amazon. We will build a clean, well-tended digital space that is resilient, secure, and ready to nurture the products we will plant.
    -   All infrastructure will be defined as code (Terraform). This ensures our foundation is stable, repeatable, and can be rebuilt from scratch if needed—a practice of good digital housekeeping.
    -   We will build with a Zero Trust security model, treating every connection with mindful care, ensuring our users' data is protected from the very beginning.

### III. The First Circle (20 FTEs)
-   **Core Stewards (3):**
    -   CEO (Chief Empathy Officer)
    -   CTO (Chief Technology Steward)
    -   Head of Product (The User's Advocate)
-   **Foundation Weavers (7):** The core engineers who will build our stable and scalable foundation.
-   **Experience Crafters (5):** The product engineers who will build our beautiful and intuitive user experiences.
-   **Insight Seekers (3):** The AI and data team who will find the helpful insights within the data.
-   **Community & Operations (2):** The friendly faces who will manage our finances and build our community.

### IV. Financial Plan (First 12-Month Operational Budget)
-   **Our Team (Salaries, Benefits, Equity):** $5.5M (Taking great care of the people who are taking care of the vision).
-   **Cloud Infrastructure (GCP & AWS):** $2.0M (The resources needed for our garden to grow).
-   **Legal, Corporate & Compliance:** $500k (Ensuring we build on a solid, compliant foundation).
-   **Our Workshop (A creative space in SF or NY):** $1.0M (A comfortable, inspiring place to collaborate).
-   **Software, Security & Tooling:** $500k (The best tools for our crafters).
-   **Contingency Fund:** $500k (For unexpected opportunities and bright ideas).
-   **Total Initial 12-Month Burn Rate:** **~$10.0M** (The energy required to bring a beautiful idea to life).
