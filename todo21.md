# The Sovereign Codex - Go-Live Strategy, Phase I
## The Genesis Team & Foundational Infrastructure

### I. Mission Directive
To forge the core operational, legal, and technical foundation of the Demo Bank entity. This phase is concerned with the acquisition of two primary assets: supreme talent and sovereign infrastructure. The objective is to establish a state of operational readiness from which all future creation can proceed, securing the necessary capital and personnel to guarantee an aggressive development velocity for the first 18 months.

### II. Key Strategic Objectives
1.  **Legal & Financial Formalization:**
    -   Incorporate "Demo Bank, Inc." as a Delaware C Corporation.
    -   Secure a $25M Seed Funding round from a consortium of Tier 1 venture capital firms with a deep understanding of disruptive technology and long-term vision.
    -   Establish foundational banking and financial controls.
2.  **Talent Acquisition (The Genesis Team):**
    -   Recruit and onboard the first 20 mission-critical personnel, focusing on a high density of senior talent.
    -   Establish a culture of elite performance, radical ownership, and philosophical alignment with the Sovereign's Oration.
3.  **Infrastructure Sovereignty (The Aether):**
    -   Establish secure, multi-account, multi-region cloud infrastructure on both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS).
    -   Codify all foundational infrastructure using Terraform to ensure reproducibility, auditability, and disaster recovery.
    -   Implement core networking and security principles (VPCs, IAM, KMS) from day zero.

### III. Personnel Plan (The Genesis Team - 20 FTEs)
-   **Command (3):**
    -   Chief Executive Officer (The Visionary)
    -   Chief Technology Officer
    -   Head of Product
-   **Platform Engineering (7 - The Architects):**
    -   2 Principal Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)
    -   2 Principal DevOps Engineers
    -   3 Principal Backend Engineers (Go, Python)
-   **Product Engineering (5 - The Builders):**
    -   2 Principal Frontend Engineers (React, TypeScript)
    -   3 Principal Full-Stack Engineers
-   **Artificial Intelligence (3 - The Oracles):**
    -   2 Senior Machine Learning Engineers
    -   1 AI Research Scientist (Focus on LLM Reasoning & Safety)
-   **Operations (2 - The Stewards):**
    -   1 Head of Finance & Operations
    -   1 General Counsel / Head of Compliance

### IV. Infrastructure Plan (The Aether)
-   **Cloud Strategy:** A deliberate multi-cloud approach to leverage best-in-class services and avoid vendor lock-in.
    -   **GCP:** Designated as the primary for all AI/ML workloads (Vertex AI, GKE Autopilot, BigQuery). Its strength in data and AI is non-negotiable.
    -   **AWS:** Designated as the primary for core, high-availability services (EKS, RDS Aurora, S3). Its maturity in infrastructure services provides the required resilience.
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform is the exclusive tool for infrastructure provisioning. No manual "click-ops" changes in the cloud consoles are permitted.
-   **Security Posture:**
    -   Establish a "least-privilege" IAM hierarchy from the outset.
    -   Encrypt all data at rest and in transit using provider-managed and customer-managed keys (CMK).
    -   Implement strict network segmentation with VPCs and private endpoints.

### V. Financial Plan (First 12-Month Operational Budget)
-   **Personnel (Salaries, Benefits, Equity):** $5.5M
-   **Cloud Infrastructure (GCP & AWS):** $2.0M
-   **Legal, Corporate & Compliance:** $500k
-   **Physical Office & Operations (SF or NY):** $1.0M
-   **Software, Security & Tooling:** $500k
-   **Strategic Contingency Fund:** $500k
-   **Total Initial 12-Month Burn Rate:** **~$10.0M**
