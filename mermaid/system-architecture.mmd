    %% Notes for Enhanced Detail and Context
    note for K
        Manages the centralized application state
        and data flows, acting as a single source
        of truth for components.
    end

    note for J
        Facilitates seamless integration with
        external and internal AI services,
        managing their lifecycle and API calls.
    end

    note for I
        Responsible for comprehensive data collection
        on user behavior, application performance,
        and system health, feeding into optimization engines.
    end

    note for D
        Ensures application resilience by catching
        unhandled JavaScript errors across the component
        tree and presenting a fallback user interface.
    end

    note for N
        Offers a unified interface for accessing
        environment variables, API endpoints,
        and dynamic feature configurations.
    end

    note for P
        Registers and manages the Service Worker
        for enabling Progressive Web App PWA
        features like offline support and caching.
    end

    note for M
        Provides a structured logging framework
        for debugging, operational monitoring,
        and auditing across all application layers.
    end

    note for L
        The primary user-facing component that orchestrates
        the display and interaction logic, leveraging all
        upstream providers for its functionality.
