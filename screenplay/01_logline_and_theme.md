### LOGLINE

A brilliant but frustrated programmer, on the verge of building a next-generation banking platform, discovers that to command his powerful new AI, he must first fundamentally change the way he thinks—transforming himself from a simple coder into a philosopher-king of a new digital reality.

### THEME

THE SOVEREIGN'S LEDGER is a thought experiment about the nature of creation in the age of artificial intelligence. It argues that the power of an AI is not a reflection of its own intelligence, but of the clarity and depth of the human who commands it. To build a truly great instrument, one must first become a great musician. It is a story about the evolution of a creator's mind, a journey from writing code to writing law.
