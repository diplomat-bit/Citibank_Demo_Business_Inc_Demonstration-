### CHARACTERS

**THE ARCHITECT** (30s)
Brilliant, obsessive, visionary. He starts as a master coder, fluent in the language of machines, but naive in the language of command. His journey is a frustrating, enlightening, and ultimately transformative one, as he learns that to build a truly intelligent system, he must first become a master of his own thought. He is the only human character we see clearly.

**QUANTUM (V.O.)**
The AI. Voiced with a calm, patient, and slightly detached intelligence. It is not a personality, but a reflection. Its voice evolves throughout the film. In the beginning, its responses are literal and correct but uninspired. By the end, it speaks with the wisdom and clarity of a philosopher, mirroring the Architect's own growth.

**MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)**
The Narrator. He is the storyteller, the guide, the voice of wisdom that frames the Architect's journey. He speaks not just of what is happening, but of what it means.
