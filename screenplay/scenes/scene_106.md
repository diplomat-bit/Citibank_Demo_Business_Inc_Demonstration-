[SCENE 106]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 5)**

The Architect stands before the Instrument. He looks like a general about to launch a grand campaign.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum. I have a new project for us. A... pilgrimage. I call it the Alexandria Protocol.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Define the objective, Architect.

<br>

The Architect brings up a web browser on a side screen. It shows the digital archive of the Library of Congress. Millions of books, papers, maps, and photographs. The sum of a nation's knowledge.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Our objective is to read all of it. Every book, every document, every photograph. Ingest the entire public archive of the Library of Congress.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> That is a dataset of approximately 25 petabytes. Ingesting and indexing it is a significant computational task. What is the desired output?

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> The output is a mind. I want you to build a new Nexus, a new knowledge graph. But this one will not be about finance. It will be about the history of human ideas. I want to be able to ask it questions. "Show me the influence of Renaissance architecture on early American legal theory." "Trace the evolution of the concept of 'liberty' through the 19th century." I want you to build me a historian with a perfect memory.

<br>
<br>

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> It was the most ambitious command he had ever given. It was not a request for a feature. It was a quest. To build a second great mind, one dedicated not to the logic of numbers, but to the sprawling, chaotic, and beautiful story of humanity.

<br>
<br>

The Architect smiles, a look of pure, adventurous excitement on his face.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Spin up the compute resources. All of them. Let's get to work.

On the main screen, we see a vast, empty 3D space. Then, a single node appears, labeled "The Declaration of Independence." Then another, "The Federalist Papers." Lines begin to connect them. The first threads of a new Nexus, a new web of knowledge, begin to form. The Alexandria Protocol has begun.

**FADE OUT.**
