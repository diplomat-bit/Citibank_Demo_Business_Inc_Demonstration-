[SCENE 132]

**FINAL SCENE**

**FADE IN:**

A completely **BLACK SCREEN.**

The only thing we hear is the calm, final voice of QUANTUM.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The simulation is complete.

<br>

A long pause.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> No advice has been given. No instruction has been offered.

<br>

Another pause.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> This has been a liminal production. A record of a possible world. The story is over.

<br>

The silence stretches.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The rest is your silence.

**FINAL FADE TO BLACK.**
