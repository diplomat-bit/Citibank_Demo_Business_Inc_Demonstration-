[SCENE 09]

**INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY (YEAR 1)**

A grand, old lecture hall. A PROFESSOR (60s, tweed jacket) discusses Wittgenstein's philosophy of language.

The Architect is in the back row, auditing the class. He's not taking notes on the lecture. Instead, he's furiously sketching on a tablet.

On the tablet screen, we see him diagramming a software architecture. He draws a box labeled "USER" and another labeled "SYSTEM." He draws a line between them.

<center>PROFESSOR (V.O.)</center>
> "The limits of my language," Wittgenstein wrote, "mean the limits of my world." A statement is only meaningful if it can be verified within the shared rules of a given language-game.

The Architect stops sketching. He highlights the line between "USER" and "SYSTEM." He labels it: "THE LANGUAGE-GAME."

He starts writing a note next to the diagram.

<center>ARCHITECT (NOTE ON TABLET)</center>
> The API is not a data pipe. It is a shared language. It defines the rules of the game. If the user's command (the statement) cannot be verified against the rules (the schema), it is meaningless. The API schema defines the limits of the system's world.

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> To build a new world, he first had to understand the laws of language. He was learning that a great architect is not just a builder, but a linguist, defining the very grammar of the reality he hopes to create.

He looks up from his tablet, a look of dawning comprehension on his face. He's not just building software anymore. He's designing a language.
