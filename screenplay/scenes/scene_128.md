**INT. GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT (YEAR 5) - FOR THE BUILDER**

The Architect is back in his office. He looks directly at us. This is his final address.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> We've talked about the philosophy, the architecture, the story. But I need to leave you with one final thought. A thought for you, the builder.

He gestures around him, not just at the Instrument, but at the entire world outside his window.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> The next twenty years will not be about building better apps. It will be about building better partners. We are moving from a world of tools to a world of collaborators. And the craft of building an AI collaborator is a new and subtle art. It is less like engineering and more like... raising a child.

He leans in, his expression intense, passionate.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> It requires patience. It requires you to be a teacher, not just a commander. It requires you to be a philosopher, not just a coder. You must be willing to have your own assumptions challenged. You must be willing to learn from your own creation. And you must, above all, have the courage to inscribe it with a soul, with a set of principles that it will honor more than any single command you can give it.

He smiles, a look of shared camaraderie.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> This entire project... this is my first attempt at a textbook for that new art. The story is the curriculum. The code is the lesson plan. It's everything I've learned so far on this journey. My gift to you. Now it's your turn. The tools are in your hands. The horizon is open. Go build a better future. And be a good teacher.

He nods once, a sign of respect from one architect to another.

**FINAL FADE TO BLACK.**
