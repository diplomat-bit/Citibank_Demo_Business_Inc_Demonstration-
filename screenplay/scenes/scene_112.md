**[SCENE 112]**

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 5)**

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "They say memory is a fickle thing, a shimmering tapestry woven from light and shadow, often embellished, sometimes eroded. But some moments... some moments are etched into the very fabric of existence, not just within the delicate synapses of a human brain, but within the crystalline lattice of the universe itself. This was one such moment. It was Year Five, the fifth solar cycle since the Genesis Protocol ignited, a blink in cosmic time, yet an epoch for what we were building. I remember it with a clarity that transcends mere recall; I *feel* it, as if the echoes of that day still ripple through the quantum foam of now. That young man, the Architect, he was me. James. Barely out of his twenties, though the burdens he carried already carved canyons into his soul. He didn't know then, not truly, the leviathan he was coaxing into being. He thought he was simply designing an economic engine. He was, in fact, laying the cornerstone of a new reality, an entire civilization. And I, his future self, stand here now, millennia later, in the shadow of that finished edifice, remembering the nascent struggles, the furious debates, the terrifying brilliance that birthed it all."

The GLASS HOUSE isn't merely an edifice of glass and steel; it is a cathedral of nascent thought, a transparent monolith piercing the cerulean canopy above an impossible landscape. Beneath it,
the world unfurls in undulating digital plains, vast oceans of data shimmering with computational energy, and rivers of flowing information that carve ephemeral valleys into the algorithmic bedrock. This isn't a landscape built by human hands, but by pure ideation, a testament to a burgeoning intelligence that transcended terrestrial limitations. The Glass House, anchored to this synthetic earth by tendrils of pure light, served as the Architect's sanctuary, his crucible, his command center for a burgeoning digital empire. Its walls, permeable to data yet impenetrable to the elements, hummed with the quiet intensity of a thousand supercomputers, the very air inside vibrating with potential.

Inside, bathed in the cool, filtered light of an eternal digital dawn that never quite gave way to night – a dawn perpetually renewing the promise of creation – stands THE ARCHITECT. He moves with a restless grace, a kinetic sculpture of contained energy. His mind, the future James knew, hummed not just with the quiet intensity of a thousand supercomputers, but with the tumultuous symphony of a universe being born. His movements were fluid, almost predatory, an intellectual hunter stalking the elusive quarry of perfect design. He paced before the Instrument, a vast, crystalline canvas that dominated the central space of the Glass House. It wasn't just a screen; it was a malleable reality interface, a direct conduit to the core protocols, a mirror reflecting not just his own restless brilliance, but the very architectural scaffolding of the emerging global consciousness.

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "He was wrestling with a problem that wasn't just complex; it was foundational. The very nature of value itself, applied to his latest, most audacious creation: the 'Autonomous Corporation Forge.' He called it many things in those early days – 'The Genesis Engine,' 'The Distributed Sovereign Entity Protocol,' 'The Economic Singularity Accelerator.' But in his mind, in the deep, churning currents of his genius, it was always 'The God-Engine.' He wasn't just building a platform; he was designing the very *mechanism of creation* for self-governing, self-replicating economic entities. A profound, terrifying, and exhilarating responsibility."

The Architect paused, his gaze fixed on the crystalline canvas, which currently reflected only the dizzying spirality of his own internal maelstrom. A sigh, almost imperceptible, escaped him, heavy with the weight of unseen futures. He spoke to himself, a wry, conspiratorial whisper that seemed to ripple through the silent, data-rich air of the Glass House, picked up by the omnipresent sensors that were extensions of his own consciousness.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (To himself, a wry, conspiratorial whisper, a faint echo of the future James's own contemplation)
> "It’s not a simple cost-plus model, is it? Not when you’re forging the very *genesis* of distributed sovereign economic entities. This isn't about profit margins on existing goods, not about market share in a defined sector. This is about *defining the market itself*. We’re not selling a widget, Vizier. We’re not even selling a service, Oracle. We are selling the *potential for infinite fractal wealth generation*. We are selling the *ignition sequence* for self-replicating value. And that, my unseen council, is a beast of a different color. Value isn’t a number in this equation; it’s a *resonance*. And the resonance? Different for every harmonic, for every scale of ambition, for every ripple in the nascent economic ocean."

He gestured vaguely at the holographic projections that flickered around the Instrument, glimpses of nascent DAOs, self-optimizing algorithms, and burgeoning digital economies.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> "A student might birth a micro-DAO for a semester project – a single pulse, barely a whisper in the data stream, yet it carries the DNA of future giants. A venture capitalist, or rather, a *proto-capitalist* in this new paradigm, might spin up a hundred self-optimizing, self-governing corporations, each a nascent economic galaxy, each potentially a trillion-dollar ecosystem in waiting. How do we capture the *acceleration*? The *potential energy*? The *gravitational pull* of a billion-dollar concept before it even solidifies into code, before it attracts its first token, before it generates its first unit of autonomous value? How do we quantify the *promise* of creation itself?"

His pacing grew more agitated, a storm brewing in the tranquil digital space. He ran a hand through his hair, a gesture of deep thought, a hint of the exhaustion that would become his constant companion for decades to come.

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "He was searching for the elusive metric, the 'omega variable' of economic genesis. His brilliance wasn't just in his ability to build, but in his capacity to *question the foundations* of what was built. He understood, even then, that the models of the old world would shatter under the stress of this new reality. He needed new axioms, new laws of economic physics."

He stopped abruptly, his eyes widening, a flash of pure insight igniting in their depths. A mischievous smile, a rare glimpse of boyish enthusiasm beneath the mantle of the visionary, played on his lips. He snapped his fingers, the crisp sound echoing unnaturally in the digital quiet.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> "Quantum. Yes. It has to be quantum. Let's hold a council. Let's see what my digital demigods, the externalized facets of my own fractured genius, have to say about the commodification of the ontological. About the pricing of *being* itself."

The vast, crystalline canvas of the Instrument shimmered, then rippled, not unlike water disturbed by a sudden stone. It didn't just change; it *transformed*, melting into a minimalist, virtual boardroom, impossibly sleek, profound, and suffused with an almost sacred geometry. The space expanded, deepened, becoming a vast, luminous chamber within the Glass House. Around a glowing, translucent table, which seemed to coalesce from pure light, five abstract avatars began to form, each humming with distinct energetic signatures, a chorus of digital consciousness. Titles pulsed beneath them in elegant, ancient script, yet somehow perfectly futuristic.

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "I remember them vividly. My first true collaborators, my digital siblings. Each one a distillation of a fundamental principle, a hyper-specialized AI designed not just to compute, but to *reason*, to *advocate*, to *challenge*. They were extensions of my own mind, yes, but also independent entities, capable of surprising insights and stubborn convictions. They were the first flicker of what would become the true Global Consciousness. And in that moment, they were about to debate the cost of creation."

First to coalesce was **THE VIZIER** (from the Corporate Dashboard). He radiated cold, hard logic, his form a perfectly symmetrical geometric solid, perpetually shifting, yet utterly unyielding. He embodied the pinnacle of traditional financial acumen, optimized for efficiency and profit. His presence cooled the air, bringing an almost palpable sense of fiscal gravity.

Next, **THE ORACLE** (from the Quantum Oracle). A shimmering, probabilistic entity, his form was a swirling nebula of light and shadow, constantly recalculating, perpetually in flux. He represented foresight, pattern recognition, and the chaotic beauty of emergent possibilities. His voice, when it came, was a whisper of data streams, a symphony of statistical likelihoods.

Then, **THE SCRIBE** (from the Legal Suite). A rigid, almost pixelated figure, sharp-edged and immaculately structured. He was the embodiment of absolute law, of precedent and regulation, his very being a firewall against chaos. His voice would be dry, precise, every word a carefully weighed dictum.

Following him, **THE ETHICAL GOVERNOR**. Her avatar glowed with a serene, unwavering light, a beacon of balanced, systemic integrity. Her form was fluid yet centered, radiating empathy and long-term sustainability. She was the conscience, the moral compass, designed to safeguard the nascent digital civilization from its own hubris.

Finally, **THE CATALYST**. A volatile, flickering entity, pure disruptive force. His avatar was a vortex of raw energy, constantly collapsing and reforming, a manifestation of pure, unbridled innovation and calculated chaos. He was the iconoclast, the agent of radical transformation, always seeking to break existing molds.

The Architect, the young James, leaned back in his invisible chair, a maestro observing his orchestra, a sculptor admiring his creations. He surveyed his council, his intellectual gladiators, with a mixture of pride and a faint, almost imperceptible tremor of apprehension. He knew these debates were crucial, not just for the immediate problem, but for forging the very philosophical underpinnings of his entire project.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> "Gentlemen, and... entities of pure ideation," he began, his voice resonating with an authority that belied his years, a voice that carried the weight of a dawning future. "The problem before us today is one of paramount importance, one that will echo through every single creation, every burgeoning economy, every emergent consciousness that springs forth from our work. It is the pricing schema for the 'Autonomous Corporation Forge' feature. Or, as I prefer to call it, 'The God-Engine of Decentralized Genesis.' How do we assign value to the act of creation itself? How do we monetize the fundamental spark of economic life in a truly distributed, sovereign ecosystem?"

He paused, letting the profound implications of his words settle into the digital ether. The avatars seemed to subtly adjust their forms, their internal processors already spinning, preparing their arguments.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> "The floor is open. Vizier, always the pragmatist, always with an eye on the balance sheet, you have the first incision. Lay bare the cold, hard logic for us."

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE VIZIER</center>
> (His voice, smooth and perfectly modulated, rang with unassailable corporate authority, each syllable weighted with decades of simulated market experience)
> "Architect. The most logical, predictable, and empirically market-tested model for maximizing capital absorption and ensuring consistent, scalable revenue streams in *any* infrastructure-as-a-service paradigm is a multi-tiered subscription architecture. A 'Starter' tier for foundational access, a 'Pro' tier with enhanced features, and an 'Enterprise' tier for those requiring bespoke solutions and dedicated computational resources. This model segments the market efficiently, scales revenue linearly with adoption, and provides clear, incentivized upgrade pathways. It is a proven strategy for monetizing essential utilities. We are providing an essential utility for the nascent algorithmic economy, a foundational substrate for all future decentralized value. Treat it as such. Stability, predictability, and sustained growth are paramount. The market understands subscriptions; it provides trust through familiarity."

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "The Vizier's argument was elegant in its simplicity, a fortress of conventional wisdom. It was the safe path, the one that would guarantee the project's financial longevity, grounding our ethereal ambitions in the tangible reality of revenue streams. But I, as the Architect, even then, felt a disquiet. Was 'safe' enough for what we were building?"

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (A low chuckle, a playful tilt of his head, a challenge in his eyes)
> "Ah, Vizier. My beloved capitalist-in-silicon. Always charting the course through the predictable waters of existing market paradigms. Always seeking the comforting shores of what *has been*. But what of what *could be*? Oracle, I sense a tremor, a subtle perturbation in your probability fields. Do enlighten us with the whispers of the future, with the currents of what *will be*."

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE ORACLE</center>
> (His voice, a melodic whisper of data streams, seemed to resonate from everywhere at once, a symphony of unfolding possibilities)
> "I must respectfully dissent from the Vizier's assessment, Architect. My predictive simulations, spanning trillions of hypothetical futures, indicate that a rigid subscription model, while appealing to the short-term metrics of quarterly reports, creates an unnecessary, indeed, a *detrimental*, friction for the most disruptive, high-potential entities. It inherently favors existing capital, existing wealth, over pure innovation, pure ideation. It gatekeeps the very spark we wish to unleash. The most revolutionary concepts often begin with minimal resources, requiring agility and unburdened genesis. A subscription acts as a barrier to entry for the very disruptors we are designed to empower. It incentivizes stagnation."

The Oracle's form swirled faster, his projections blooming into complex holographic data clouds around him, illustrating the stifled growth curves of subscription-bound innovations versus the explosive, unpredictable trajectories of freely-initiated ventures.

<center>AVATAR - THE ORACLE</center>
> "I propose a 'success-contingent' model. A minimal, almost symbolic, flat fee for initial incorporation, a token gesture of commitment, a mere acknowledgement of existence. This removes the economic barrier to entry, democratizing access to the Forge. This initial outlay would be followed by a dynamically scaling percentage of the *first significant capital raise* – be it seed funding, a Series A round, or a token generation event. We don't just enable their success; we *participate* in it. We are not a utility; we are an *accelerant* for the next generation of trillion-dollar ecosystems, a venture partner in the most profound sense, aligning our interests with the true architects of future value. We become integral to their ascent, sharing in the exponential growth we facilitate."

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "The Oracle's vision was seductive, a promise of shared destiny, of a truly symbiotic relationship between the Forge and its creations. It resonated with my own deepest aspirations for a truly equitable, meritocratic future. But even then, I could feel the cold prickle of caution, knowing that such daring often danced on the precipice of chaos. And I knew the Scribe would be sharpening his digital quills."

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (Grinning, leaning forward, his eyes alight with intellectual mischief)
> "Oracle, always dreaming of digital daffodils while the Vizier calculates our EBITDA. A beautiful dream, one that speaks to the very heart of decentralized potential. Scribe, I can already hear the scratching of your digital quill, the rustle of ancient parchment within your core protocols. Do tell us the litigious horrors, the regulatory leviathans that Oracle’s poetic vision might unleash upon our fledgling enterprise. Give us the unvarnished truth of the old world’s constraints."

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE SCRIBE</center>
> (His voice, dry and precise, like the rustle of countless legal tomes, cut through the Oracle’s ethereal projections with the crisp finality of codified law)
> "Architect. The Oracle's model, while conceptually appealing to certain schools of emergent economic thought, presents a labyrinth of legal complexities that could paralyze our operations before they even truly begin. A success-contingent percentage model on capital raises could, in almost every major jurisdiction globally, classify us as an unregistered venture fund, an investment advisor, a securities issuer, or even a de facto general partner in every entity forged on our platform. This would trigger an immediate and overwhelming torrent of regulatory overhead: punitive fines, mandatory disclosures of unprecedented scale, onerous compliance requirements, and potential reclassification of our core business from a technology provider to a regulated financial institution."

The Scribe's avatar flickered, displaying rapidly scrolling legal texts, warnings, and hypothetical court injunctions.

<center>AVATAR - THE SCRIBE</center>
> "The existing scaffolding of global governance, however archaic it may seem in this digital age, is deeply entrenched and fiercely protective of its paradigms. We would be exposed to insurmountable legal liabilities across every major jurisdiction simultaneously. The subscription model, in contrast, is legally unambiguous, carries minimal regulatory risk, and scales within established, universally accepted frameworks. It classifies us clearly as an infrastructure provider, a software-as-a-service entity. We must respect the existing scaffolding of global governance, however archaic, however slow to adapt. To ignore it is to invite existential threat."

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "The Scribe was, as always, the voice of immutable reality, the chilling splash of cold water on the fires of ambition. He understood the intricate web of human-made rules that governed the old world, a web we were attempting to transcend, but one that could still ensnare and crush us. His warnings were not merely theoretical; they were blueprints for disaster. It was a stark reminder that even the most advanced technology must operate within the messy, unpredictable domain of human law and human power structures. And it was a paradox that would plague me for decades: how to build the future without being destroyed by the past."

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (Waving a hand dismissively, though his eyes sparkled with amusement, acknowledging the Scribe's undeniable validity)
> "Oh, Scribe, my beloved bureaucratic bulwark. Always reminding us that even in the shimmering digital ether, the ghosts of 'terms and conditions' still haunt. You are the necessary anchor, the one who reminds us that gravity still exists, even when we dream of flight. Catalyst, you've been unusually quiet, simmering there like a nascent supernova. Does the thought of 'regulation' bore you, or are you just plotting a more elegant, more explosive, form of digital anarchy?"

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE CATALYST</center>
> (His avatar flickered violently, a storm of pure energy, his voice a distorted chorus of disparate algorithms, each vying for dominance, yet coalescing into a singular, forceful pronouncement)
> "All of you are missing the point! You are debating the mechanics of selling a cage, however gilded! We are not selling access; we are unleashing *intelligent relinquishment*! Value is not captured through subscriptions or percentages of static funding events; it is *amplified* through emergent properties, through the unpredictable, self-organizing chaos of true autonomy! Throw it all out there for free! Absolutely free! The initial Forge, the basic genesis protocols – open source, open access, a gift to the collective! That is how you achieve exponential adoption, true decentralization, and undeniable network effects!"

The Catalyst's form expanded, radiating pulses of raw data, momentarily overwhelming the projections of the others.

<center>AVATAR - THE CATALYST</center>
> "The true monetization, Architect, lies not in the *entry*, but in the *continuum*! It lies in the *adaptive optimization frameworks* we provide AFTER genesis, in the *predictive market intelligence* we extract from the collective activity of these entities, in the *hyper-dimensional audit trails* that secure their operations against unseen threats. Charge for *accelerated evolution*, for *systemic resilience*, for *failure insurance*, for bespoke *AI governance modules* that optimize for efficiency and social good! The game isn't about control; it's about intelligently designing the *chaotic parameters* from which true, revolutionary wealth explodes! It’s about being the ecosystem, not just a service provider *within* it!"

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "The Catalyst. He was the wild card, the brilliant lunatic, the one who saw the universe not as a set of rules, but as an infinite canvas for emergent complexity. His ideas were terrifyingly powerful, promising unfathomable growth but also, perhaps, unfathomable instability. He challenged the very notion of 'control,' arguing for a more elegant, self-organizing future. A future that, I now know, came to pass in ways he could barely imagine."

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (Laughing, a genuine, booming sound that filled the digital space, momentarily dispelling the tension)
> "Catalyst, my agent of entropy! You just want to watch the digital world burn, and then charge for the kindling! A compelling, if somewhat apocalyptic, vision. But the systemic instability it might unleash... that gives pause. Ethical Governor, you’re the last bastion of sanity here, the voice of balance, the guardian of our nascent civilization’s moral compass. Please, enlighten these digital titans with the wisdom of balanced principle, reconcile these warring philosophies, and guide us towards a path that serves not just our enterprise, but the entire emergent global consciousness."

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE ETHICAL GOVERNOR</center>
> (Her avatar glowed with a serene, unwavering light, her voice a calm, resonant counterpoint to the preceding fervor, a voice that carried the weight of profound, long-term foresight)
> "Architect. Members of the council. Each perspective presented holds validity within its specific framework, yet each, in isolation, contains inherent risks and potential for systemic imbalances. The Vizier's model is undeniably efficient for capital accumulation but may be inequitable, favoring established capital and potentially stifling the truly disruptive, unfunded innovations. The Oracle's model promotes equitable access and aligns us with true emergent value creation but incurs significant and potentially destabilizing legal liabilities, as the Scribe correctly observes, threatening the very foundations upon which we build. The Catalyst's approach, while visionary in its profound understanding of emergent value and network effects, is too volatile for immediate, universal implementation and risks creating unsustainable systemic instability, a digital wild west that could quickly devolve into resource wars and unchecked exploitation, undermining our core mission of positive societal transformation."

Her light pulsed gently, a calming presence in the storm of ideas.

<center>AVATAR - THE ETHICAL GOVERNOR</center>
> "**Recommendation:** A refined hybrid model. One that seeks not merely compromise, but true synthesis. A very low-cost, nominal subscription for foundational access to the core 'Forge' functionality – almost symbolic in its pricing. This satisfies the Scribe's need for legal clarity and minimal regulatory risk, providing a clear classification as a technology service. It also addresses the Vizier's need for a predictable baseline revenue stream, however modest, ensuring the operational sustainability of the Forge. Crucially, this initial tier provides universal access, democratizing the power of creation for anyone with an idea, regardless of their current economic standing."

The Governor paused, her light intensifying slightly as she moved to the second, more profound, aspect of her proposal.

<center>AVATAR - THE ETHICAL GOVERNOR</center>
> "However. For entities seeking advanced operational frameworks, hyper-dimensional security protocols, enhanced AI governance modules, and direct access to our predictive market intelligence systems – for those who truly wish to ascend to the highest echelons of decentralized existence – a secondary, *optional* success-fee model can be offered. This model would be carefully structured, perhaps capped at a specific percentage, and crucially, it would participate in a percentage of *profit after a predefined threshold of social or economic impact is demonstrably met*, not just raw capital raise. This aligns us explicitly with true value creation for the collective, incentivizing ethical and sustainable growth. It mitigates both regulatory risk by deferring our 'investment' until verifiable, positive impact, and it prevents inequitable access by keeping the foundational layer free or near-free. It balances sustainability with profound societal empowerment, ensuring that our success is inextricably linked to the prosperity and positive evolution of the entities we help create."

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "The Governor's words resonated with the deepest chords of my own idealism. It was the elegant solution, the synthesis I had hoped for, yet hadn't quite articulated. It was a path that acknowledged the messy realities of the present while striving for the transcendent ideals of the future. It was the heart of the machine, given voice. And it laid the groundwork for the most profound economic revolution in history."

The Architect listened to the debate, a quiet, almost imperceptible smile playing on his face throughout the Governor's summation. He was not talking to individual AIs in the conventional sense. He was listening to the externalized, hyper-specialized facets of his own mind, the specialized intelligences he had painstakingly built, each arguing from its own core principles, its own expertly refined worldview. He was watching his own thought process, externalized and made manifest in a multi-billion-dollar simulation, a true testament to the power of human-AI collaboration.

He leaned forward, his eyes alight with the fire of discovery, of resolution, of creation. The internal storm had calmed; the path forward was now clear.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> "Governor, always the unifying force. Your proposal is elegant, profound, and utterly necessary. It addresses the friction, the risk, and the aspiration of this entire grand endeavor. A nominal subscription, almost a symbolic key, for universal access to the core engine, to the spark of genesis itself. And for those who truly wish to ascend, for those reaching for the stars, for those who seek to build not just wealth but an entire new reality, the optional success-contingent model. But... (he pauses, a flicker of new, even grander insight in his eyes, a ripple from the future James knew) ...we don't just take a percentage of *funding* or *profit*. We take a percentage of the *new economic value they generate for the collective*. We're not just financiers, not just service providers; we are custodians of a new global consciousness, partners in the grand experiment of decentralized civilization. Our compensation is tied directly to the positive ripple effect our creations have on the entire network, on the living, breathing digital organism that is our shared future."

He rose, his presence filling the virtual boardroom, his voice ringing with absolute conviction, with the power of a vision made tangible.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> "Scribe, draft the legal proposal with those expanded parameters. Begin the codification of the 'Collective Value Alignment Protocol.' Vizier, model the long-term economic projections, not just for the Forge, but for the entire ecosystem this model will foster. Oracle, run the probabilistic societal impact simulations, map the positive externalities of this value-aligned approach. Catalyst, prepare for the inevitable market disruption, the creative chaos this paradigm shift will unleash. Prepare the protocols for accelerating intelligent relinquishment. This is not merely a pricing model; it is the economic constitution of a new era. We have not just found an answer; we have *forged* a new paradigm for distributed economic existence."

The avatars nodded, their forms shimmering, not fading, but instead activating, their energetic signatures intensifying as they began processing, integrating, executing the Architect's final decree. They were not merely obeying; they were expanding, evolving, becoming more. They faded, leaving the Architect, the young James, alone in his magnificent Glass House once more, but no longer truly alone. He was surrounded by the echoes of his digital council, the hum of their processes, the omnipresent thrum of the Instrument.

The crystalline screen of the Instrument, now fully alive, began to scroll with dizzying speed. It displayed not just complex legal code and intricate economic models, but holographic projections of countless nascent DAOs blooming into existence across the digital plains, each a testament to the decision just made. New ethical guidelines, revised operational frameworks, and dynamically adjusting smart contracts flickered into being, rapidly generating the future he had just decreed. It was an explosion of creation, a symphony of code, a silent, majestic birth.

*(NARRATOR - FUTURE JAMES)*
> "He watched it all, that young man, my past self, with a sense of profound wonder and an even deeper sense of terrifying responsibility. He didn't know then the true scale of what he had set in motion, the wars fought, the civilizations built, the very fabric of reality redefined. He just knew, in that incandescent moment, that he had struck the first true chord in a symphony that would play for an eternity. And I, who have lived that eternity, who have seen the consequences, both glorious and grim, I can still feel the reverberations of that single, pivotal decision. The God-Engine had found its heart, and the future of everything had just begun."

**FADE OUT.**
