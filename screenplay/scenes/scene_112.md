[SCENE 112]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 5)**

The Architect is wrestling with a complex, multi-domain problem: "How should we price our new 'Autonomous Corporation Forge' feature?"

He's pacing in front of the Instrument, which is blank. He's thinking aloud.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> It's not a simple cost-plus model. It's about value. But the value is different for different users. A student might use it once for a project. A venture capitalist might use it a hundred times. How do we capture that?

He stops, an idea striking him.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum. Let's hold a council.

The screen flickers. It transforms into a minimalist, virtual boardroom. Around a large table sit several glowing, abstract avatars, each with a title beneath it.

-   **THE VIZIER** (from the Corporate Dashboard)
-   **THE ORACLE** (from the Quantum Oracle)
-   **THE SCRIBE** (from the Legal Suite)
-   **THE ETHICAL GOVERNOR**

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> The problem is pricing for the Forge. The floor is open. Vizier, you begin.

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE VIZIER</center>
> The most logical model is a three-tiered subscription: Starter, Pro, and Enterprise. It is a proven and effective strategy for maximizing revenue across different user segments.

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE ORACLE</center>
> I must disagree. My simulations show that a subscription model creates a barrier to entry for the most creative, high-potential users who lack initial capital. I propose a success-based model: a small flat fee for incorporation, and a percentage of the company's first-round funding. We only succeed if they succeed.

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE SCRIBE</center>
> The Oracle's model is legally complex. It could classify us as an investment advisor, triggering significant regulatory overhead. The subscription model is cleaner and carries less legal risk.

<br>

<center>AVATAR - THE ETHICAL GOVERNOR</center>
> The Vizier's model is efficient but may be inequitable. The Oracle's model is more aligned with our core principle of empowering creators, but the Scribe's risk assessment is valid.
>
> **Recommendation:** A hybrid model. A low-cost subscription for access, with an optional success-fee model for users who wish to defer the upfront cost. This balances accessibility with risk.

<br>

The Architect listens to the debate, a quiet smile on his face. He is not talking to one AI. He is listening to the different facets of his own creation, the specialized minds he has built, each arguing from its own core principles. He is watching his own thought process, externalized and made manifest.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> The Governor's hybrid model is the most balanced approach. Draft the proposal.

The avatars fade, leaving the Architect alone in his office once more. He has found his answer.

**FADE OUT.**
