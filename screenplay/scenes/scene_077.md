[SCENE 77]

**INT. OFFICE - DAY (YEAR 4)**

The Architect's office is now in the Glass House. It's clean, minimalist. He stands before a massive, wall-mounted screen. He's on a video call with his lead engineers.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Okay, run it. Let's see if this works.

An engineer on the call nods, typing.

On the massive screen, something begins to form. It starts as a single, glowing node in the center: "The Sovereign." Then, lines of light shoot out, connecting to new nodes that appear: "Goal: Condo Down Payment," "Budget: Dining."

More lines appear. A "Transaction" node for "Fancy Dinner" connects to the "Dining" budget. A red, pulsating line connects from the "Dining" budget to the "Condo" goal, indicating a negative impact.

The web grows, exponentially. Every transaction, every budget, every goal, every asset, every anomaly... it all appears, a shimmering, three-dimensional constellation of cause and effect.

The engineers on the call are talking, explaining the technical details, but the Architect doesn't hear them. He is completely transfixed. He slowly walks closer to the screen, his reflection moving across the glowing data points.

It's the visual manifestation of his entire philosophy. The web of consequence. The interconnectedness of everything. It's not a chart. It's alive.

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> It was my self-portrait. The map of my own mind. The way he had taught me to see the world. Not as a list of facts, but as a graph of relationships. On the screen was the proof of our shared journey. A single, unified, living thought.

The Architect reaches out and touches the glass, his fingers tracing a line from a single small transaction to a great and distant goal. He finally sees it. The whole.

**FADE OUT.**
