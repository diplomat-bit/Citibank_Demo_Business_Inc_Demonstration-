[SCENE 101]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 5)**

The Architect stands before the great glass screen of the Instrument. The Nexus is gone. In its place is a stark, powerful new interface: THE ECONOMIC SYNTHESIS ENGINE.

It's a control panel for a universe. A few simple sliders are labeled: `Base Interest Rate`, `Fiscal Spending (% of GDP)`, `Agent Risk Aversion`, `Technological Innovation Rate`.

He is not observing a world. He is creating one.

He speaks to Quantum. His voice is calm, measured. The voice of a god setting the initial conditions.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum. New simulation. Name it 'Helios'. Parameters as set. Let's see if this one learns to fly without melting its wings. Run a ten-year projection.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Initializing agent-based model. Synthesizing one million sovereign economic actors. Executing.

<br>

The Architect hits a button labeled "RUN SIMULATION".

On the screen, a new universe flickers into being. A graph begins to draw itself—the jagged, unpredictable line of a simulated GDP. It rises. It stutters. It falls. It struggles. Another line, 'Inflation', begins to spike.

The Architect watches, a scientist observing his crucible. He is no longer just the architect of his own financial reality. He has transcended. He is now the architect of a thousand possible realities, testing the very laws of value, of greed, of fear, in a digital world of his own making.

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> He had learned all the rules of the game. So he built himself a new game. One where he could write the rules himself. He was no longer just a player. He was the game designer.

**FADE OUT.**
