The garage is more organized now. A second monitor has been added. The chaotic energy is beginning to coalesce into focused intensity.

The Architect is hunched over his keyboard, staring at a new, complex interface he's trying to build—the first version of the Quantum Weaver. The AI's responses are inconsistent, sometimes brilliant, sometimes useless.

He's not angry anymore. He's a scientist observing a strange new phenomenon.

He begins to type, formulating his discovery into a set of laws. We see the text appear on his screen.

1.  **Persona:** *Give the AI a role to play. `act as a skeptical venture capitalist`.*
