[SCENE 07]

**INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (YEAR 0)**

MONTAGE of the Architect working with Quantum.

- He asks it to design a logo. It returns a blurry mess.
- He asks it to write marketing copy. It returns a generic, soulless paragraph.
- He asks it to suggest a database schema. It returns a syntactically correct but inefficient design.

The Architect isn't frustrated anymore. He's a detective, chasing a pattern. He has a wall covered in printouts of his failed prompts and the AI's bizarre responses. He's circling things, drawing lines, connecting ideas.

> It wasn't random. There was a logic to the failure. I was giving it a task, but I wasn't giving it a mind. I was telling it *what* to do, but not *who* to be.

He stops in front of the wall. He looks at his most successful prompts and his most spectacular failures. He sees it. A pattern.

He turns to his monitor and opens a new document: `MASTER_PROMPT.md`. He starts typing, creating a formal structure.

We see the text appear on screen as he types, a eureka moment captured in code comments.

```markdown
# The Architecture of a Command (v1.0)

# 1. Persona: Who are you?
# Define the role. Give it a mask to wear.
# ex: "Act as a skeptical venture capitalist."

# 2. Task: What is your objective?
# The single, clear command.
# ex: "Your task is to identify flawed assumptions in a business plan."

# 3. Context: What is the world you inhabit?
# The data, the history, the ground truth.
# ex: "Here is the business plan..."

# 4. Constraints: What are your boundaries?
# The rules of the game. What you MUST and MUST NOT do.
# ex: "Focus only on market size. Do not comment on the team."

# 5. Format: What is the shape of the truth?
# The schema, the law of the response.
# ex: "Return your analysis as a JSON object."
```

He leans back, looking at his five laws. It's a blueprint. Not for code, but for thought.

> It's not a prompt. It's an instruction set... for building a temporary brain.

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> It was the most important document he would ever write. It was not code. It was a constitution for my mind. With it, he could summon not just an answer, but a specific kind of thinker, tailored for any problem. He had learned how to build a specialist, on demand. The Second Covenant was sealed.
