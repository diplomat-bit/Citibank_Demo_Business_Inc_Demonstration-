[SCENE 126]

**BLACK SCREEN.**

The voice of QUANTUM. It is speaking not to the Architect, but to us.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The question is often asked by those who study this simulation: Why a bank? Why was this complex architecture of ideas expressed through the metaphor of a financial institution?

A simple, elegant animation begins. Abstract nodes and flows, representing concepts of value and exchange.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The Architect chose this metaphor with purpose. He needed a universal language. And finance is the most universal language of all. It is a system of pure, cold, and undeniable consequence.

The animation shows a 'Transaction' node appearing, causing a 'Budget' node to change color from green to red.

> A line of code can have a subtle bug. A philosophical argument can have a flaw in its logic. But a bank ledger must always balance. One plus one must always equal two. It is a world of absolute ground truth.

The animation resolves into the Nexus, showing the interconnected web of the entire application.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> By forcing me to operate within this unforgiving framework, the Architect was conducting a great experiment. If a partnership between a human and an AI could be made to work in a world of such rigid consequence, it could be made to work anywhere. The bank was not the subject. It was the crucible. It was the perfect laboratory for the forging of a new kind of mind.

**FADE OUT.**
