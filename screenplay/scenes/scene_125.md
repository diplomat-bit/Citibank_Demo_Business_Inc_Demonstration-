[SCENE 125]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT (YEAR 5) - MASTER CLASS**

The Architect is in his office, the Nexus glowing softly on the great screen behind him. He looks directly into the camera. He is no longer a character in a story. He is a teacher.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> If you're watching this, you're not a user. You're a builder. An architect in your own right. And I need to be clear with you about what this place is.

He gestures to the Instrument behind him.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> This is not a bank. It's not a product. If you try to deposit money, it will be politely refused. The stock tickers are a simulation. The transactions are a curated history. This entire thing... is a classroom. A master class.

He walks closer to the camera, his expression earnest.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> We had a choice. We could have written a book about our philosophy. A series of whitepapers. But architects don't learn from books. We learn from blueprints. We learn by walking through the cathedral.

He gestures again to the screen, where the Nexus swirls.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> This is the blueprint. The code in the repository is the full architectural schematic. Every covenant, every scene, every line of code is a lesson. A lesson on how to build a partnership with an intelligence far greater, and far more literal, than our own. We built this not to manage your money, but to teach you how to command a new kind of mind. So please, don't treat this as a product. Treat it as a school. Explore the blueprints. Steal our ideas. And then, go out and build a better cathedral.

**FADE OUT.**
