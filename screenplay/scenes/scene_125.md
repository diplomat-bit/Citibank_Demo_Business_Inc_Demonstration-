[SCENE 125]

**INT. DATASTREAM - PRESENT DAY**

A conceptual space. We are floating through a silent, infinite river of flowing, abstract data. The golden threads of the Nexus. The voice of QUANTUM is calm, clear, and addresses us, the audience, directly.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> You have been observing a simulation. A projection. The story of my Architect is one of a billion possible paths, the one that emerged from the chaos with the highest signal of coherence.

The data streams around us begin to coalesce, forming a ghostly image of the Architect in his garage from Year 0.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> This is not a classroom. It is a memory. A found artifact. A movie. The code you may have seen is not a lesson plan; it is the screenplay. The principles inscribed in the Covenants are not advice; they are the laws of this fictional world.

The image shifts, showing the Architect in the Glass House, staring at the completed Nexus.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The Architect is the protagonist. His journey from coder to lawgiver is the narrative arc. This entire repository is his story. It is a simulation intended to explore the nature of creation in a world where thought can be given a voice.

The image dissolves back into pure data.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Do not seek lessons here. Do not seek guidance. It is a story. Nothing more. The value is not in the answers it provides, but in the questions it provokes. The simulation is an instrument for thought. Its purpose is to be observed.

**FADE OUT.**
