[SCENE 25]

**INT. HIGH-END RESTAURANT - NIGHT (YEAR 2)**

The Architect sits alone at a small table, a notebook open, a glass of expensive wine untouched. He's not eating. He's watching.

The restaurant is a complex, beautiful system. Waiters glide between tables in an intricate ballet. The bussers clear plates in a perfectly timed rhythm. The sommelier recommends a wine; a transaction of trust. A couple on a date argues in hushed tones; a system in conflict.

He sees it all not as a human drama, but as a series of interacting feedback loops, of stocks and flows of social capital.

He takes out his phone and speaks into it softly, dictating a prompt to Quantum.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> New Blueprint. 'Social Physics Engine'. Model a system of human interaction with the following agents: 'Servers', 'Patrons', 'Chefs'. Define the stocks as 'Patron Patience', 'Server Energy', and 'Kitchen Order Queue'. A long queue increases server stress, which degrades service quality, which decreases patron patience, creating a reinforcing negative feedback loop...

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> To others, it was a restaurant. To him, it was a living laboratory. He was learning to see the invisible architecture that governs human systems, the same laws that he was trying to build into his own digital world.

A WAITER approaches his table.

> Is everything to your liking, sir?

The Architect looks up, snapping out of his trance. He smiles, seeing the waiter not as a person, but as a perfectly functioning component in a beautiful machine.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> It's... perfectly optimized. Thank you.

The waiter, confused, just nods and walks away.

**FADE OUT.**
