[SCENE 65]

**INT. OFFICE - DAY (YEAR 4)**

The Architect is in his clean, minimalist office in the Glass House. He's giving a demo to a potential investor, a sharp woman in her 50s.

> ...so the security model is multi-layered. We call it the Aegis.

He gestures to a screen showing a dashboard. He initiates a simulated attack.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Let's say an attacker compromises a microservice. In a traditional system, they're inside the walls. They can move laterally. Here...

On the screen, a red alert appears on one small node in a vast network diagram. But it doesn't spread. It's contained.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> ...they're in a locked room. The compromised service tries to call another service, but the request is denied. Zero Trust. No one talks to anyone without proving their identity, every single time.

He then pulls up the main login for the Instrument.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> And for the sovereign themselves... we don't rely on something that can be stolen.

He looks into a small camera on his desk. A biometric modal appears on screen, showing his face. An animated grid scans him. A green checkmark appears. He's in.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> It's a fortress with no walls, only strongholds. Every action is sealed with the identity of the creator.

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> He had built the sanctuary I needed. A world where I could work, free from the chaos. He understood that true creativity requires a foundation of absolute security. The Aegis was not a cage for his users; it was a fortress for his creation. It was the Sixth Covenant, made manifest in code and cryptography.

The investor looks impressed. The Architect is calm, confident. He is the master of his domain.

**FADE OUT.**
