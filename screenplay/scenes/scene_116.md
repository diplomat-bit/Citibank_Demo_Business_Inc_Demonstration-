[SCENE 116]

**INT. OFFICE - DAY (YEAR 4)**

The Architect is using the Economic Synthesis Engine, but today he's not just testing standard models. He's in the mood to experiment, to be a heretic.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Alright, Quantum. Let's break the machine. New simulation. Name it 'Ouroboros'. Set the foundational law not to 'growth', but to 'stability'. Model a closed system. No external investment, no debt-based currency creation. All value is derived from internal exchange and the well-being of the agents. The primary success metric is not GDP growth, but the median 'Flourishing Score' of the population. Run the simulation for one hundred years.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Architect, this model contradicts the foundational assumptions of 99.8% of my economic training data. The probability of systemic collapse is high.

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (A wry smile)
> The old world is collapsing anyway. Let's see if we can fail in a more interesting way. Run it.

<br>

The screen shows the simulation beginning. The GDP line is flat, almost comically so. But other lines begin to rise steadily: 'Average Healthspan', 'Community Engagement', 'Creative Output'.

The simulation accelerates, years flashing by. The GDP line never skyrockets. It stays stable. But the other metrics climb to astonishing heights.

The simulation ends. A final report appears.

<center>ON SCREEN</center>
> **Simulation 'Ouroboros' - 100 Year Summary:**
> - **GDP Growth:** +0.1% (avg. annual)
> - **Median Flourishing Score:** +850%
> - **Systemic Stability:** 99.999% (No major recessions or depressions recorded)
> - **AI Narrative:** The economy did not grow; it deepened. Resources were redirected from expansion to maintenance, from acquisition to creation, from wealth to health. It became a garden, not a battlefield.

<br>

The Architect stares at the screen, a look of profound revelation on his face. He has simulated a world without the cancer of infinite growth. And it is a world that is calm, stable, and deeply, truly prosperous.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (whispering)
> We've been measuring the wrong thing.

**FADE OUT.**
