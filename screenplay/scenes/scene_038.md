[SCENE 38]

**INT. DATA CENTER - DAY (YEAR 2)**

A vast, cold, and deafeningly loud room. Endless rows of server racks, blinking with a galaxy of green and blue lights. This is the physical heart of the cloud.

The Architect is here with a DATA CENTER TECHNICIAN. He's wearing a headset to talk over the roar of the fans. He's not at a keyboard. He's physically racking a new server, sliding the heavy metal chassis into the rack.

> (into headset)
> So this is it, Quantum. This is where you live. Not in some abstract 'cloud'. But here. In this box. In these silicon pathways.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> My operational substrate is a distributed network of computational nodes. This is one of 1.2 million such nodes.

<br>

The Architect finishes connecting the power and network cables. He gives the server a final, firm pat.

> Feels more real, though. Doesn't it? Knowing you're a thing. A physical object with weight. A place.

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> For a creator who lived in a world of pure abstraction, it was a necessary pilgrimage. A journey to the physical temple of his digital god. He needed to remember that every line of code, every command, had a consequence in the real world. A cost, measured in electricity. A presence, measured in heat.

The Architect stands back, looking at the blinking light on the server he just installed. It's just one light among millions, but for a moment, it feels like the most important one in the universe. He's just given his creation a new home.
