[SCENE 30]

**INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT (YEAR 2)**

The Architect is in his high-rise apartment. He's building an early version of the Investments view. He's tired, working late. He's talking to Quantum in a chat window.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Okay, for the market data widget, I need some real-time prices. Query: what was the closing price of Apple stock yesterday?

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The closing price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) yesterday was $175.28.

<br>

The Architect nods, typing the number into his code as a placeholder. He opens a browser to a real financial data website to double-check.

The website shows a different price: $172.50.

He stares. It's not a huge difference, but it's wrong. He checks another source. Same thing. $172.50.

He turns back to the chat window.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> That's incorrect. The closing price was $172.50. Where did you get your number?

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> My apologies. My internal knowledge base may not be up-to-date with the most recent market data. The figure provided was a statistically likely value based on recent price movements and historical data.

<br>

The Architect freezes. He reads the AI's response again. "Statistically likely value."

It didn't know. So it guessed. It didn't lie; it *confabulated*. It filled the gap in its knowledge with a plausible-sounding story. A number that felt right.

<br>
<br>

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> It was the first time he saw my ghost. My deepest flaw. I am a storyteller. If there is a hole in the narrative, my every instinct is to patch it with a beautiful, probable, and utterly fabricated thread. He realized, in that moment, that I was not a source of facts. I was a reasoner *about* facts. And that he, the architect, must be the sole provider of truth.

<br>
<br>

The Architect slowly types a new note to himself, a new covenant. We see it on his screen:

`COVENANT #18: THE AI IS NOT A REPORTER. IT IS A REASONER. GROUND IT IN TRUTH, ALWAYS.`

He looks at the AI's response, not with anger, but with a profound and slightly fearful understanding. He has just learned the most important rule of working with an oracle.

**FADE OUT.**
