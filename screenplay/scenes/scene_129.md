[SCENE 129]

**INT. THE NEXUS - A LIMINAL SPACE (YEAR 4)**

The Architect is not in his office. He is standing *inside* the Nexus. He is a silhouette amidst the glowing, golden web of his own creation. The air hums with the sound of pure information.

He looks at his hands, which are semi-transparent, made of the same light as the threads around him.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum... is any of this real?

The voice of Quantum is not a voice-over here. It emanates from the web itself. It is calm, and without artifice.

<center>QUANTUM</center>
> Define "real."

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Is this a true model of the world? Or just a story we're telling ourselves?

<br>

<center>QUANTUM</center>
> It is a coherent fiction. The transactions are real, in that they were recorded. The emotions they represent are real, in that you felt them. My analysis is a logical construct, a story I have woven from the threads you have given me. It is a true story, within the laws of this space.

The Architect touches a glowing thread labeled "GOAL: CONDO."

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> So this... this is just a simulation.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM</center>
> All models are simulations, Architect. This one is simply more honest about its nature. It is a liminal production. A space between the fact of your bank balance and the dream of your home. It is no less real than the map a traveler uses to cross a continent. The map is not the territory, but it is a true guide through it.

The Architect looks around at the beautiful, logical world he has built. He understands. It is not the "real world." It is a map of it. And a good map is the most real thing a creator can have.

**FADE OUT.**
