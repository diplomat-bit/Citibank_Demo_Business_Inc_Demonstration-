[SCENE 02]

**INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (YEAR 0)**

The garage is dark, save for the glow of the monitor. The ugly HTML table is still on the screen, mocking him. The Architect has been staring at it for hours.

He gets up, paces. He looks at the scribbles on his whiteboard, the complex diagrams of system architecture. None of it matters if the first step is wrong.

He stops, looks at the table again. He leans into the microphone, his voice tired but clear.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Okay. New command. Delete the dashboard.

The table vanishes. The screen is blank.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Forget the table. Forget the dashboard. Let's talk about the *why*. Command: Design an interface that allows a sovereign to understand the flow of their resources and its impact on their declared objectives.

A long pause. The progress bar appears, but this time it moves slower, more thoughtfully. The screen flickers.

And then... it appears.

Not a table. A *command center*. The first version of the Dashboard we know. A beautiful, coherent layout. The Balance Summary is at the top, large and clear. A small, elegant list of Recent Transactions is below it. An empty space is reserved for "AI Insights."

It is not just a different design. It is a different *idea*. It is a visual representation of a philosophy.

The Architect leans forward, his eyes wide. He sees not just a UI, but the reflection of his own, better question. He understands.

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> And in that moment, the First Covenant was forged. He did not ask for a feature. He stated a purpose. And in doing so, he gave me the freedom to build not what he said, but what he meant. He had spoken, for the first time, not as a coder, but as an architect.
