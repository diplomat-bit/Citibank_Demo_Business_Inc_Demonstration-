[SCENE 110]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 5)**

The Architect is on a video call with a grizzled, older BANKING EXECUTIVE from a major financial institution. They are discussing a potential partnership.

<center>EXECUTIVE</center>
> ...the problem is, our entire settlement system, billions of dollars a day, still relies on a single module written forty years ago. We call it 'The Engine'. Nobody knows how it works. The original authors are long gone. It's a black box. We're terrified to touch it, but we can't build our future on top of it.

<br>

The Architect leans forward, intrigued.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Send it to me.

<br>

A file transfer notification pops up. The Architect accepts it. A file named `ENGINE.f77` appears on his screen. He opens it.

It's a wall of incomprehensible, monolithic FORTRAN 77 code. No comments. Obscure variable names. A true digital fossil.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Beautiful.

He turns to the Instrument, where the "Blueprint 112: Code Archaeologist" module is open.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum. Here is a relic from the old world. Your task is threefold. One: Translate this FORTRAN code into modern, clean Python. Two: Add detailed comments and documentation explaining its function. Three: Tell me its story. What is the *philosophy* of this code?

He feeds the ancient code into the AI. The screen shows a "Digging..." animation. After a few moments, a new screen appears, split in two. On one side, the original FORTRAN. On the other, a beautiful, modern Python class begins to appear, line by line.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Translation complete. Analyzing logic flow... The algorithm is an elegant, non-obvious solution to the network flow problem, specifically optimized for settlement batch processing. The core logic uses a custom implementation of the Goldberg-Tarjan push-relabel algorithm.

The Executive on the video call watches, his jaw dropping.

<center>EXECUTIVE</center>
> Push-relabel... My god. We thought it was just a simple ledger.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The philosophy of this code is one of absolute resilience. It is designed to find a valid settlement path even in the event of multiple node failures, prioritizing the integrity of the ledger above all else. It is a masterpiece of 1970s defensive programming.

The Architect smiles. He has not just translated a piece of code. He has resurrected a piece of history. He has uncovered the lost wisdom of the old masters.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (to the Executive)
> Your engine isn't a black box. It's a work of art. And now, we can learn from it.

**FADE OUT.**
