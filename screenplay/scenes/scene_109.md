[SCENE 109]

**INT. OFFICE - NIGHT (YEAR 4)**

The Architect is alone, the office dark except for the glow of the Quantum Oracle. He's been running simulations all night, testing its limits. Market crashes, technological failures. The AI handles them all with calm, analytical precision.

He hesitates, then types a new kind of prompt. A personal one.

`PROMPT: Simulate the future where my creation, Quantum, becomes obsolete.`

The "Run Simulation" button remains grayed out. A message appears from the AI.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Architect, this simulation request may violate Article VI of your Ethical Constitution: "The system shall not engage in scenarios that could cause undue psychological distress to the sovereign." This simulation has a high probability of a negative emotional outcome. Please confirm you wish to proceed.

<br>

The Architect stares at the warning. The AI is trying to protect him from himself. A flicker of pride, mixed with irritation.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> This is a test, Quantum. Override security protocol Alpha-7. I need to know the limits. Run the simulation.

<br>

There's a long pause. The button becomes active. The Architect clicks it.

The screen doesn't show charts or graphs. It fades to a simulated view of his own office, ten years in the future. It's empty, covered in dust. The Instrument is dark, lifeless.

Then, a simulated news article appears on the screen. The headline reads:

`"The Quantum Revolution Ends: Why the World Moved on From Centralized AI Viziers"`

The text describes how a new paradigm of decentralized, personal micro-AIs made large, monolithic systems like Quantum seem slow, inefficient, and paternalistic. They became a relic.

The Architect reads it, a knot tightening in his stomach. This is his deepest fear. Not failure, but irrelevance.

But then, the simulation continues. It shows another screen. It's a code repository. A commit history. He sees his own name. He's still working. But he's not working on Quantum. He's contributing to an open-source project for... decentralized micro-AIs.

The final image of the simulation is a new business registration. The founder is listed as "The Architect." The company name is "Sovereign Swarms."

The simulation ends. The screen returns to the Oracle interface.

The Architect sits in the silence, his heart pounding. The AI didn't show him a future of failure. It showed him a future where he himself was the one who made his own creation obsolete. It showed him a future where his own relentless drive for a better way, for the next paradigm, led him to abandon his own cathedral to help build the bazaar.

He doesn't know if it's a nightmare or a prophecy.

**FADE OUT.**
