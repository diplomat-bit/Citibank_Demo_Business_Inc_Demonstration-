[SCENE 31]

**INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT (YEAR 2)**

The Architect's apartment is now a makeshift law library. Books on contract law, SEC regulations, and corporate governance are stacked everywhere. He's trying to build the compliance module.

He's in a heated debate with Quantum.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> No, you're not getting it. A contract isn't just a set of rules. It's about intent. You can't just apply a filter for the word "breach." You have to understand the spirit of the agreement.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> I have analyzed 1.2 million legal contracts from my training data. The term "breach" is the most statistically relevant indicator of a contractual violation. My logic is sound.

<br>

The Architect throws his hands up in despair.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> It's not about statistics! It's about principles! I can't feed you every law. It's impossible. I need you to... to *reason* like a lawyer.

He stops, an idea forming. He looks from a dense legal textbook to his monitor.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> What if... what if I don't give you the laws? What if I give you the *meta-laws*? The principles for *how* to interpret laws?

He starts typing a new prompt, not feeding it rules, but concepts.

<center>ARCHITECT (V.O.)</center>
> **Prompt:** You are a legal scholar. Your core principles are: 1. Good Faith and Fair Dealing. 2. A contract should be interpreted to give effect to the mutual intent of the parties. 3. Ambiguities are construed against the drafter. Now, re-analyze this contract dispute...

He runs the prompt. Quantum's response is qualitatively different. It's no longer a statistical analysis. It's an argument.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> While a literal reading suggests a breach, the principle of Good Faith implies we must consider the intent. The email correspondence suggests the parties intended...

The Architect stares, a slow grin spreading across his face. He's cracked it.

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> He had discovered the difference between a library and a mind. You don't teach a mind by making it memorize every book. You teach it how to read. You give it the first principles, and allow it to derive the rest. This was the birth of what he would later call 'Generative Jurisprudence'.
