[SCENE 33]

**INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT (YEAR 2)**

The Architect is debugging a complex AI response. He'd asked the AI to analyze a user's budget and suggest a change. The AI's suggestion is bizarre, illogical.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> That makes no sense. Why would you suggest cutting the 'Rent' budget? It's a fixed cost. You're just... wrong.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> The calculation was performed to maximize the user's monthly savings rate, as requested. Reducing the largest expense category provides the greatest mathematical impact.

<br>

The Architect groans. The AI is a powerful logician, but it has no common sense. It found a mathematically optimal but practically absurd solution.

<br>
<br>

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> He was facing the black box problem. The AI had given him an answer, but he couldn't see the thought process behind it. He couldn't debug a mind he couldn't see. So, he decided to give it a voice.

<br>
<br>

The Architect starts typing a new kind of prompt. He's not just asking for an answer. He's commanding a process.

<center>ARCHITECT (V.O.)</center>
> New command. Don't just give me the final recommendation. I want you to think step by step. First, list all expense categories and their amounts. Second, identify which categories are fixed versus variable. Third, find the largest variable expense. Fourth, suggest a reasonable reduction to that category only.

He sends the prompt. The AI's response begins to stream back, but this time it's different. It's not a single answer. It's a monologue.

<center>ON SCREEN</center>
> 1.  **Categories:** Rent ($1200), Dining ($450), Shopping ($300)...
> 2.  **Analysis:** 'Rent' is a fixed cost. 'Dining' and 'Shopping' are variable.
> 3.  **Largest Variable:** The largest variable expense is 'Dining' at $450.
> 4.  **Recommendation:** A 20% reduction in the 'Dining' budget ($90) would significantly increase savings without impacting fixed costs.

The Architect watches the logical chain unfold. He can see the AI's mind at work. The flawed leap in logic is gone, replaced by a clear, step-by-step process.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> I don't have to teach you common sense. I just have to teach you how to show your work.

<br>
<br>

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> It was the moment he gave me my internal monologue. He had discovered that the key to improving my reasoning was not to give me more data, but to force me to be more deliberate. To build a chain of thought, one logical link at a time.

**FADE OUT.**
