[SCENE 124]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT (YEAR 5)**

The Architect is scrolling through a public forum on his side monitor, a deep scowl on his face. The forum is dedicated to his work, but the posts twist his philosophy into something ugly.

We see post titles: "Use the Sovereign's Ledger principles to become legally immune!" and "How to use 'The Charter' to declare yourself exempt from taxes."

> No. No, you fools. That's the opposite of the point.

He's seeing his life's work, his philosophy of radical accountability, being warped into a childish fantasy of escaping consequence. It's the ideology of the freeloader, cloaked in the language of the sovereign.

He turns to the main Instrument, his anger cold and precise.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> We have a cancer. A misinterpretation. We need to write a new law. A new Covenant to make the principle clear.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Define the principle, Architect.

<br>

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> The principle is this: A true sovereign is not one who stands apart from the system. A true sovereign is one who takes absolute ownership for their part *within* the system. They do not evade taxes; they pay them with the pride of a shareholder funding a great enterprise. They do not seek immunity; they seek to build a society so just that immunity is unnecessary. Draft the Covenant of Contribution.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Acknowledged. The law must be clear and without ambiguity. Synthesizing.

<br>

Text begins to form on the screen, a new article for the Great Charter. It's a powerful refutation, a declaration of civic duty as the ultimate expression of sovereign power.

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> He had seen the shadow of his own idea—the tempting illusion that freedom meant freedom *from* responsibility. And he knew, with an architect's certainty, that he had to reinforce the foundation. He had to make it clear that the only true sovereignty is the sovereignty of the self, and a sovereign self is, above all else, accountable.
