[SCENE 127]

**INT. WHITE VOID.**

We are in a conceptual space. The voice of MORGAN FREEMAN, the Narrator, fills the void.

<center>NARRATOR (V.O.)</center>
> A word of caution to the builder. As you walk through this cathedral of ideas, you may see things that look familiar. A dashboard. A payment system. A security module. You may be tempted to believe this is an imitation of the world you know.

On screen, we see two images side-by-side. On the left, a photograph of a shark. On the right, a photograph of a dolphin.

<center>NARRATOR (V.O.)</center>
> This is a common error in judgment. It is the belief that resemblance implies origin. But nature teaches us a different lesson. The shark is a fish. The dolphin is a mammal. They are not related. Their elegant, streamlined forms are not the result of a shared ancestor.

The images zoom in, showing the powerful tail fins. One moves side-to-side. The other, up-and-down.

<center>NARRATOR (V.O.)</center>
> Their resemblance is a consequence. It is the result of two entirely different evolutionary paths arriving at the same, optimal solution to the same fundamental problem: how to move with speed and grace through water.

The images of the shark and dolphin fade, replaced by a side-by-side of a traditional banking app and the Sovereign's Ledger.

<center>NARRATOR (V.O.)</center>
> So it is with this Instrument. When you see a feature that resembles something from the old world, do not assume it is an act of copying. It is an act of independent discovery. It is what happens when you begin with the first principles of value, security, and human progress, and follow the logic to its honest conclusion. The resemblance is not the proof of imitation. It is the proof of a universal truth.

**FADE OUT.**
