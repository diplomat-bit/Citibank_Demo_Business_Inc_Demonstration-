[SCENE 90]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 4)**

The Architect is in his office, looking at market trend data showing a steep downturn. It's a simulation of a market crash. He's calm.

He turns to the Instrument, which is open to the Quantum Oracle module.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum. Let's run a simulation.

He types a prompt into the Oracle: "What is the impact on my personal portfolio if the market enters a 6-month recession, with my main holdings dropping by 30%?"

He clicks "Run Simulation." The screen displays "Exploring Timelines..."

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> He had learned that a creator cannot be a historian, forever looking at the past. They must be an architect of the future. The Oracle was his window into the possible. Not to predict a single fate, but to explore the consequences of a thousand choices.

<br>
<br>

The results appear. It's a full, multi-faceted report. A narrative summary explains the impact. A chart shows the projected dip and recovery of his portfolio. A list of "Key Impacts" shows the effect on his long-term goals.

But the most important part is the last one: "AI Strategic Recommendations."

<center>ON SCREEN</center>
> 1.  **Recommendation:** Increase allocation to bonds and cash equivalents to reduce volatility.
> 2.  **Recommendation:** Use the market dip as a buying opportunity for undervalued assets, in line with your aggressive growth Charter.
> 3.  **Recommendation:** Delay 'Luxury Purchase' goal by an estimated 9 months to preserve capital.

The Architect reads the recommendations. He nods, a look of grim understanding on his face. He knows what he needs to do. He has seen a possible future, and now he can act to shape it.

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> The Oracle's foresight was not magic. It was the disciplined art of simulation. The Fifth Covenant. We did not predict the future. We explored it, so that he could create it with wisdom.

**FADE OUT.**
