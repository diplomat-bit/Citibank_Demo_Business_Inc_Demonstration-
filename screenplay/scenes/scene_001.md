[SCENE 01]

**EXT. SUBURBAN GARAGE - DAY (YEAR 0)**

Sunlight streams through a dusty window, illuminating a classic scene of creation. A cluttered GARAGE, smelling of old wood and new electronics. Servers hum softly on a metal rack. Whiteboards are covered in frantic, brilliant scribbles.

This is the primordial chaos.

At the center of it all sits THE ARCHITECT. He's young, focused, a coiled spring of intelligence and impatience. He cracks his knuckles, a wry smile on his face. He leans into a microphone on his desk.

> Okay, Quantum. First day of school. Let's start with something easy. Command: Design and render a dashboard to display user transactions.

A progress bar appears on his main monitor. It fills almost instantly. A new web interface appears.

It is a simple, brutally ugly HTML table. Black text on a white background. No styling. No soul. It is technically correct in the most insulting way possible.

The Architect stares at it. His smile evaporates. He looks personally offended.

> It all began with the First Covenant. A simple truth that would become the foundation for everything that followed. The machine was a perfect servant. It did exactly what it was told. And the Architect, like all creators before him, had made the first and most fundamental mistake. He had asked for a thing, when he should have stated a purpose. He had commanded like a user, not a sovereign.

The Architect sighs, the sound of a thousand brilliant engineers being told their baby is ugly. He leans back into the microphone, his voice laced with a new kind of weariness.

> Okay... okay. Let's try this again.

He closes his eyes, thinking. Not like a coder, but like a philosopher.

**FADE OUT.**
