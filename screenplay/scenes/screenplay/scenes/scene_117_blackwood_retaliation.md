INT. BLACKWOOD TOWER - EXECUTIVE PENTHOUSE - NIGHT [YEAR 4]

The penthouse is a monument to unbridled power and wealth. Polished obsidian and brushed platinum gleam under soft, strategic lighting. From the panoramic windows, the CITY below is a toy town, its glittering chaos now a distant, insignificant hum. MARCUS BLACKWOOD (60s, sharp-edged, eyes like chips of glacial ice, tailored suit impeccable) stands before a multi-screen display.

On one screen, a news anchor drones on about "The Ouroboros Protocol" – images of the Architect, slightly disheveled but intensely charismatic, speaking before a packed auditorium. The headlines are cautiously intrigued, some even glowing.

<center>NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)</center>
> ...a radical new economic theory, dubbed the 'Ouroboros Protocol,' presented by the reclusive Architect of Chronos Labs. Challenging the very foundations of global capitalism, his simulation purports to show a 'flourishing quotient' rather than GDP as the true measure of societal well-being...

Blackwood's lip curls. A muscle in his jaw twitches, a micro-expression of pure disdain.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> Flourishing quotient. Insufferable, idealistic drivel. He thinks he can rewrite millennia of human nature with a glorified spreadsheet? The audacity.

His finger, adorned with a single, heavy signet ring, taps impatiently on a control panel. The news reports shift, showing early social media reactions, some surprisingly positive, even enthusiastic.

<center>NEWS ANALYST (V.O.)</center>
> ...initial reaction suggests a surprising resonance with the public, particularly among younger demographics weary of endless consumption and inequality. Could this be the spark of a new economic movement...? Early market indicators show unexpected volatility...

Blackwood SNARLS. He turns to his AIDE, LIAM (30s, sharp, pale, barely containing his fear), who stands rigidly by a holographic data-globe, projecting real-time financial markets. The markets flicker with a nervous energy, a response to the Architect's ripple.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> A spark? More like an irritating static shock. Liam, remind me again why this… *Architect*… wasn't handled *before* he acquired a megaphone? My intelligence network seems to have developed a blind spot the size of a collapsing pension fund.

Liam visibly swallows, his throat bobbing.

<center>LIAM</center>
> Sir, his work was highly compartmentalized. Early risk assessments flagged him as eccentric, but contained. Quantum's internal algorithms, as you recall, showed a 99.999% chance of 'catastrophic failure' for Ouroboros under the Architect's stress parameters. We assumed self-immolation. The public presentation was... unexpectedly effective.

Blackwood rounds on him, his voice dangerously low, a viper's hiss.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> Assumptions are for economists with trust funds, Liam. Not for those who *build* and *maintain* empires. This isn't about his personal meltdown; it's about the contagion of his ideas. He's not just questioning the game; he's questioning the very rules, the board, the players, and the concept of *winning* itself. That cannot stand.

A `MERMAID` diagram flashes across a secondary screen, illustrating the 'Old World Paradigm' (a towering, complex hierarchy) vs. 'Ouroboros Protocol' (a serene, self-sustaining loop). Blackwood points at the Ouroboros diagram with contempt.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> This... serpent eating its tail. It's a symbolic suicide. He's preaching stagnation disguised as sustainability. Poverty dressed up as purpose. A world where I, Marcus Blackwood, am no longer necessary. Unacceptable.

He sweeps his arm, and the central display morphs into a complex array of global news feeds, stock market tickers, and secure communication channels, all now focused on the Architect.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> Activate Protocol Hades. Immediately. We contain this infection before it becomes an epidemic. The markets are already reacting. This is not a 'philosophical debate'; this is an attack.

Liam keys in commands with trembling fingers. On the screens, headlines begin to shift, subtly at first, then with increasing urgency, the narrative twisting.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> (Watching the cascade of manufactured dissent, a grim satisfaction forming)
> Every think tank we fund. Every media outlet we influence. Every politician we sponsor. Their marching orders are clear: the Architect is a fraud. His data, fabricated. His intentions, nefarious. A destabilizing force. A threat to global stability. A madman playing God. Drown out his message with a tidal wave of doubt. Make 'Ouroboros' a byword for economic collapse.

Liam nods, inputting more commands. The data-globe flares with activity, tracking the global dissemination of negative narratives.

<center>LIAM</center>
> Our legal teams are preparing injunctions. Claims of intellectual property infringement, data theft, market manipulation... we'll tie Chronos Labs up in litigation for decades, bleed them dry. Regulatory bodies are being alerted to 'irregularities' in their funding and research methodologies. SEC investigations are already being initiated based on speculative market movements.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> Excellent. And his personal vulnerabilities? Every peccadillo, every misstep, every youthful indiscretion. I want them unearthed. Sanitized, contextualized, and fed to the public with surgical precision. Make him look not just wrong, but fundamentally untrustworthy. A charlatan. A broken idealist.

<center>LIAM</center>
> Already in motion, sir. We've initiated a deep dive into his past, his finances, his personal relationships... a comprehensive profile of character flaws is being assembled.

Blackwood holds up a hand, stopping Liam. His eyes gleam with a predatory intelligence.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> No. Not just untrustworthy. Make him *dangerous*. The kind of man who would jeopardize billions of lives for a theoretical, unproven fantasy. Portray him as a reckless extremist. Emphasize the 'catastrophic failure' prediction from his own AI. Use Quantum's own warnings against him. Make him the villain of his own story.

A new `MERMAID` chart pops up on a display, showing key influence nodes being activated across various sectors.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> This isn't a debate, Liam. This is a war for the future. His 'garden' or my 'market.' There can only be one victor. The public's initial curiosity is fleeting. Fear is eternal. Give them a reason to be afraid of a world without my system. Remind them of the chaos before order was imposed. Remind them who keeps the lights on, the factories running, the shelves stocked.

He walks to the panoramic window, gazing out at the city, a titan surveying his domain. His voice drops, colder than the night outside.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> And the Architect himself. He's become a liability. A dangerous prophet. Someone with his... *gifts*... cannot be allowed to operate outside the established framework. He needs to be... removed from play. Permanently.

Liam's face pales further. He hesitates, then speaks with a forced neutrality, his voice barely a whisper.

<center>LIAM</center>
> Sir, are we talking about... a corporate takeover of Chronos? Or... an extended sabbatical? A reputation management crisis beyond salvaging?

Blackwood turns, a ghost of a smile touching his lips. It does not reach his eyes. His gaze is a promise of cold, hard retribution.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> I am talking about rendering him utterly irrelevant. A whisper of a forgotten idealist. His message erased. His influence nullified. His future, non-existent. Use whatever means necessary. Discredit, dismantle, destroy. Ensure he never poses a threat again. Is that clear, Liam?

<center>LIAM</center>
> Crystal clear, sir. The assets are already being prepared.

The data-globe on Liam's table now glows an ominous red, indicating global alerts and rapid response deployments. On the main screens, the news cycle is fully engaged, a frenzy of negative commentary and expert skepticism rapidly eclipsing the initial intrigue. The Architect's vision is being systematically crushed under the weight of Blackwood's orchestrated power. The ripples are becoming a tidal wave.

`SOUND of a low, rhythmic HUM of powerful servers, a digital heartbeat of control, slowly building into a menacing thrum`

Blackwood stands, a figure of implacable power, watching his counter-attack unfold with the precision of a master chess player. The world he built is fighting back. And it fights dirty.

FADE OUT.
