INT. BLACKWOOD TOWER - MARCUS BLACKWOOD'S PENTHOUSE OFFICE - DAY [YEAR 3]

The air in Marcus Blackwood's penthouse office is as meticulously conditioned as his personal brand. Below, the CITY sprawls, a titan of commerce, indifferent to the faint, persistent hum of global economic anxiety. Up here, on the 100th floor, that anxiety is merely a distant echo, drowned out by the reassuring whisper of power.

MARCUS BLACKWOOD (60s, a predator in a tailored suit, every silver hair in place) sits behind an obsidian desk, framed by a panoramic view of his empire. His eyes, like polished stones, betray nothing but shrewd calculation. Flanking him are two of his most trusted BOARD MEMBERS, their faces impassive, their allegiance absolute. He sips from a delicate teacup, its porcelain thin as a secret.

Standing before a minimalist holographic display, the ARCHITECT (30s, intense, his suit slightly rumpled, a stark contrast to Blackwood's immaculate precision) gestures with controlled urgency. He looks out of place, a lone prophet in a temple of Mammon, his unsettling data dancing in cool light.

<center>THE ARCHITECT</center>
> (His voice a sandpaper rasp, edged with suppressed frustration, as he points to a cascade of red lines on the display, depicting debt spirals and accelerating resource depletion)
> ...and this, Mr. Blackwood, is the inevitable conclusion of the current 'growth at all costs' paradigm. Our simulations indicate a critical systemic collapse within three decades. Not a recession. A fundamental unraveling. The debt-based currency system, coupled with exponential resource consumption and escalating social inequality, creates a feedback loop that is mathematically unsustainable. It's a house of cards, meticulously stacked, but resting on a fault line. We are, quite literally, borrowing from tomorrow to fund today's indulgence, at an interest rate our children cannot possibly repay.

Marcus Blackwood raises an impeccably manicured hand, not to interrupt, but to signal dismissal, a gesture he has perfected over decades of ruling boardrooms.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> (His voice like polished steel, utterly devoid of warmth, a subtle wave of his hand towards the flickering data)
> Dr. Elias Vance, if I may. 'Architect.' A rather... grand title for someone who specializes in catastrophic hypotheticals. You've presented us with what appears to be a very expensive, very elaborate doomsday projection. Again. My analysts assure me your models are fascinating, mathematically complex even. But utterly devoid of real-world applicability. Where is the 'growth,' Doctor? Where is the 'opportunity'? I see only red lines and fear-mongering.

A `MERMAID` DIAGRAM flashes briefly on a smaller screen behind Blackwood, showing "Profit Maximization" as its central node, with arrows pointing relentlessly to "Market Share," "Shareholder Value," and "Aggressive Expansion."

<center>THE ARCHITECT</center>
> (Voice tight, leaning into the holographic display, his eyes burning)
> The 'growth' you champion, Mr. Blackwood, is cancerous. It consumes its host. We're not seeing genuine value creation; we're seeing asset stripping on a planetary scale. Look here! (He points to a graph illustrating a widening chasm between productivity and wages) The system is designed to funnel wealth upwards, creating a super-elite while dispossessing the majority. This isn't 'progress'; it's a regression to a new feudalism, dressed in digital clothes.

One of the BOARD MEMBERS (FEMALE, 50s, sharp, but subservient to Blackwood) clears her throat, her expression carefully neutral.

<center>BOARD MEMBER</center>
> (Smooth, corporate-speak, designed to soothe and deflect)
> Dr. Vance, with all due respect, our Q3 reports show record profits across the sector. GDP is up 2.7% globally. Unemployment is at a twenty-year low. Consumer confidence is robust. The market is strong. Your 'unraveling' seems... highly speculative, given the current economic climate. Perhaps a bit premature?

<center>THE ARCHITECT</center>
> (A dry, humorless LAUGH escapes him, shaking his head slowly)
> Premature? We're ignoring the symptoms! Your 'record profits' are built on unsustainable credit, exploited labor, and a collapsing biosphere! Do you truly believe infinite growth is possible on a finite planet? It's an ecological impossibility, an economic lie! We are approaching the event horizon. We need to fundamentally redefine value, shift from extraction to regeneration, from competition to collaboration, before the system collapses under its own weight. I'm talking about a paradigm shift, an 'Ouroboros Protocol,' where resilience, not relentless expansion, is the primary driver.

Blackwood sets down his teacup with a faint, precise CLINK that cuts through the Architect's passionate plea. His gaze, devoid of emotion, fixes on the Architect.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> (Calm, authoritative, utterly dismissive)
> 'Ouroboros Protocol.' Fascinating nomenclature. Sounds like something from a particularly esoteric self-help seminar. Dr. Vance, your idealism, while quaint, is not profitable. And profit, Doctor, is the engine of progress. It funds your research, it builds these towers, it lifts billions from... (a dismissive wave of his hand) ...whatever difficulties they may face. Without the drive for more, for *expansion*, we stagnate. We regress. Are you suggesting we content ourselves with some kind of global subsistence farming model? A return to the pre-industrial age? Because that, I assure you, is a non-starter. Our investors demand returns, not abstract philosophical constructs about 'regenerative economies.'

A subtle `MERMAID` graph appears on the Architect's holographic display, showing "Old World Paradigm" (represented by Blackwood's Tower and a rising stock market graph) vs. "Regenerative Paradigm" (depicted as a thriving ecosystem and a flat 'sufficiency' line), with conflicting objectives and wildly divergent outcomes.

<center>THE ARCHITECT</center>
> (His voice now rising, losing the battle for corporate decorum, raw passion overriding caution)
> You measure progress in quarterly earnings, Mr. Blackwood! I measure it in livable futures! We are actively destroying the very foundation upon which any future prosperity could be built! Your 'progress' is a slow-motion suicide! Your investors will have nothing left to invest in when the oceans acidify and the climate renders vast swathes of the planet uninhabitable! When the social fabric tears itself apart under the strain of unimaginable inequality!

Blackwood stands, a clear signal that the meeting is concluded. He walks slowly around his desk, his posture radiating unassailable authority, a king in his own dominion.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> (Reaching the Architect, his voice dropping to a low, measured warning tone, a predatory calm)
> Dr. Vance. I appreciate your... unique perspective. Truly. But I run a global enterprise. I deal in tangible assets, proven methodologies, and predictable returns. Your theories, while intellectually stimulating to some, are disruptive without offering a viable, scalable alternative that doesn't plunge us into economic chaos. People want jobs, Doctor. They want opportunity. They want progress. They want *more*. And my system delivers that. Yours, by your own admission, is a radical re-evaluation of 'value' that I suspect most of humanity would find profoundly unappealing.

He places a hand briefly, almost paternally, on the Architect's shoulder – a gesture that feels less like reassurance and more like a barely veiled threat.

<center>MARCUS BLACKWOOD</center>
> Continue your interesting simulations in your lab, Doctor. Perhaps you'll uncover a way to profit from planetary collapse. Until then, I suggest you focus on practical applications. Things that move the needle. Things that generate actual wealth, not just... existential dread. Our current trajectory is perfectly acceptable. The market has always corrected itself. And it will again. Thank you for your time.

Blackwood gestures subtly to a security guard, who instantly steps forward, indicating the Architect's exit.

The Architect stares at Blackwood, then at the sprawling, indifferent city beyond the panoramic windows, his expression a mix of profound despair and fierce, nascent resolve. They are not just on different pages; they are in different realities, separated by a chasm of understanding. He is dismissed, but not defeated. The seed of a revolution, or perhaps a desperate last stand, ignites behind his eyes.

<center>THE ARCHITECT</center>
> (Voice barely a whisper, to himself, as he is escorted out)
> It doesn't correct itself, Marcus. It consumes itself. And you're fueling the furnace.

FADE OUT.
