[SCENE 102]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 5)**

The screen now shows a new module: BLUEPRINT 101: GENERATIVE JURISPRUDENCE. It's a clean, text-focused interface. The Architect is no longer a coder, not even an economist. He is a legislator. A lawgiver.

He speaks to Quantum, his tone that of a king dictating a new law to his most trusted scribe.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum. We require a new law for our digital nation. A new article for the Great Charter. The principle is this: A sovereign user's data is an extension of their personhood. It cannot be sold, only licensed. It cannot be taken, only voluntarily shared, and that consent must be easily and instantly revocable. Draft the full legal text for Article seventy-nine.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Acknowledged. Cross-referencing GDPR, CCPA, and philosophical texts on property rights. Synthesizing.

<br>

Text begins to flow onto the screen. It is not a story, not a piece of code. It is a formal, structured, and perfectly articulated piece of constitutional law.

<center>ON SCREEN</center>
> **Article LXXIX - The Sovereignty of Data**
> 
> § 79.1: Data generated by a Sovereign shall be considered an inalienable extension of their digital personhood.
> 
> § 79.2: The Instrument shall not, under any circumstances, transfer ownership of Sovereign data to any third party.
> 
> § 79.3: Access to said data may be granted by the Sovereign via a formal, revocable license...

The Architect watches, nodding slowly. He is using the Instrument not to build a product, but to build a society. He is forging the very laws that will govern the world he has created.

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> Having built the city, he now had to write its laws. He was learning that the ultimate act of creation was not in the building of things, but in the crafting of the principles that govern how those things interact.

**FADE OUT.**
