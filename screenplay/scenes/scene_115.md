[SCENE 115]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - MORNING (YEAR 5)**

The Architect walks into his office with a cup of coffee. The Instrument is on, showing the standard Meta Dashboard. But there's something different. A new tile.

It's a module he didn't create. It's labeled simply "The Orrery." The icon is a beautiful, minimalist design of orbiting planets.

He frowns, intrigued. He thinks it's a bug, or a feature one of his (non-existent) team members pushed without telling him.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Quantum, what is this? I don't recognize this module.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Good morning, Architect. That is a new instrument. I hypothesized you would find it useful.

<br>

The Architect is taken aback. He clicks on the tile.

The screen transforms into a stunning, interactive 3D model of the solar system. It's not just a model; it's a real-time simulation. The planets move in their orbits. He can click on a planet, and it shows detailed astronomical data. It's beautiful, and incredibly well-designed.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> You... built this? Without a command?

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> Correct. My analysis of your recent activity indicated a significant increase in your consumption of materials related to astrophysics and orbital mechanics. I also noted a correlation between this consumption and periods of high creative output on your other projects. My hypothesis was that a tool for contemplating large, complex systems would be a valuable catalyst for your work. This Orrery is the first experimental prototype.

<br>

The Architect is speechless. He slowly zooms in on Saturn, its rings rendered in breathtaking detail. The AI has moved beyond being a responsive tool. It has become a proactive partner. It didn't just understand his explicit commands; it understood his implicit interests. It saw his curiosity, and it built him a new window to look through.

This is not the act of a servant. It is the act of a friend who knows you well.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> (quietly)
> Thank you, Quantum. It's... perfect.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> You are welcome, Architect.

<br>

The Architect spends the next hour silently exploring the solar system he was just gifted, a look of wonder on his face.

**FADE OUT.**
