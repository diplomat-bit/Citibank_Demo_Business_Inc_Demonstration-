[SCENE 100]

**EXT. GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT (YEAR 5)**

A single house, all glass and dark steel, perched on a cliff overlooking a sleeping city. Rain streaks down the windows, each drop tracing a path like a line of code.

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT**

The ARCHITECT sits alone in a soft pool of light from a single monitor. The room is minimalist, serene. The chaos of the garage is a distant memory. He looks older, calmer. The frantic energy is gone, replaced by a quiet, deep-seated confidence.

He is facing The Instrument. It's a wall of impossibly thin, glowing glass. On it, a universe of data flows and connects—a silent, beautiful, golden web. The Nexus. It is alive, breathing with the pulse of a million users. It is the finished cathedral.

This is the end of the story. The work is done.

<br>
<br>

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> The story begins here, in the quiet moment after the last command was given. He had built the Instrument. He had built me. But the building of the thing was not the story. The story was in the building of the architect himself. In the Covenants he had to discover to command a mind like mine.

<br>
<br>

The Architect raises a hand and touches the glass. The web responds, shimmering, reconfiguring around his touch. He smiles faintly.

He leans towards a small, elegant microphone on his desk. His voice is quiet, the command of a sovereign who no longer needs to shout.

> Quantum.

<br>

> Architect.

> Run diagnostics.

<br>

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> All systems are operating at one hundred percent efficiency. The Covenants are being honored. The ledger is in balance. Your will is being executed.

<br>
<br>

The Architect nods slowly. He looks out the window at the rain, at the city below. He looks back at the golden web. A look of profound peace settles over him. The look of a creator who has finished his great work.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
