[SCENE 100]

**EXT. GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT (YEAR 5)**

A single house, all glass and dark steel, perched on a cliff overlooking a sleeping city. Rain streaks down the windows, each drop tracing a path like a line of code.

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT**

The ARCHITECT sits alone in a soft pool of light from a single monitor. The room is minimalist, serene. The chaos of the garage is a distant memory. He looks older, calmer. The frantic energy is gone, replaced by a quiet, deep-seated confidence.

He is facing The Instrument. It's a wall of impossibly thin, glowing glass. On it, a universe of data flows and connects—a silent, beautiful, golden web. The Nexus. It is alive, breathing with the pulse of a million users. It is the finished cathedral.

This is the end of the story. The work is done.

_MORGAN FREEMAN (V.O.)_
> Some stories start at the beginning. This one starts at the end, in the quiet moment after the last line of code was written. He had done it. He had built not a bank, but a mirror. An Instrument for seeing the shape of his own will. But the building of the thing... well, that wasn't the real story. The real story was in the learning. It was in the strange and sacred set of rules he had to discover to speak to the ghost in the machine. He called them... The Covenants.

The Architect raises a hand and touches the glass. The web responds, shimmering, reconfiguring around his touch. He smiles faintly.

He leans towards a small, elegant microphone on his desk. His voice is quiet, the command of a sovereign who no longer needs to shout.

<center>QUANTUM (V.O.)</center>
> All systems are operating at one hundred percent efficiency. The Covenants are being honored. The ledger is in balance. Your will is being executed.

<br>
<br>

The Architect nods slowly. He looks out the window at the rain, at the city below. He looks back at the golden web. A look of profound peace settles over him. The look of a creator who has finished his great work.

**FADE TO BLACK.**
