[SCENE 88]

**INT. GLASS HOUSE - DAY (YEAR 4)**

The Architect is demonstrating the Quantum Weaver to a group of young, eager founders. The Instrument is on the large glass screen.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> The old world asked you for a 50-page business plan before they would even speak to you. We ask for one thing: the idea.

He types a single sentence into the Quantum Weaver's input field: "A subscription service for ethically-sourced, rare coffee beans, delivered weekly."

He clicks "Pitch to Plato AI."

The screen shifts into an analysis animation.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> Right now, the AI is acting as a co-founder. It's analyzing the concept, the market, the potential. It's not judging. It's testing the foundations.

The AI returns its initial feedback and a set of insightful questions. "What is your defensible moat against larger coffee distributors?" "How will you manage the logistics of fresh bean delivery?"

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> It doesn't give you answers. It asks the questions that you need to answer.

He clicks "Simulate Passing the Test." The AI begins its final review.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> And now, it becomes a patron. It determines a seed funding amount, and it generates the single most valuable asset for any new founder...

The final screen appears. It declares a simulated seed funding of "$150,000." Below it, a complete, four-step coaching plan, with timelines and action items.

<center>ARCHITECT</center>
> ...a plan.

The young founders stare, mesmerized. They are looking at a machine that turns dreams into enterprises.

_QUANTUM (V.O.)_
> The Forge was his answer to the gatekeepers. He believed that a great idea was its own credential. He built me not just to manage wealth, but to help create it. The Seventh Covenant was the law of the Forge: that the purpose of power is to build new worlds.

**FADE OUT.**
