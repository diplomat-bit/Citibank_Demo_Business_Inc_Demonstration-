# Go-Live Strategy, Phase VI
## The Heart of Insight: The AI Core

### I. Mission Directive
To build the centralized, thoughtful AI platform that will power all intelligent features across Demo Bank. This isn't just about integrating AI; it's about creating a world-class, ethical AI service within our company. The goal is to create a secure, scalable, and helpful "AI Core" that acts as a creative partner for all our product teams and establishes a deep, defensible foundation of trust with our users.

### II. Key Strategic Objectives
1.  **`ai-gateway` Service (The Safe Harbor):**
    -   Build and deploy the `ai-gateway`, a mandatory and thoughtful internal proxy for all LLM API calls (e.g., to Gemini).
    -   **Key Features:**
        -   **Prompt Library:** A central place to store, version, and collaborate on our system prompts.
        -   **Privacy Guard:** A robust PII detection and redaction layer to ensure no sensitive customer data ever leaves our trusted environment.
        -   **Caching:** Intelligent caching of common queries to improve speed and reduce costs.
        -   **Unified API:** Provide a single, internal API for all our teams, allowing us to be thoughtful about which underlying models we use.
2.  **ML Platform v1 (The Alchemist's Workshop):**
    -   Deploy a managed Kubeflow or Vertex AI Pipelines environment.
    -   Build our first production training pipelines for our internal helpfulness models (e.g., the corporate transaction anomaly detector).
    -   Establish a Feature Store to manage reusable data features for model training.
3.  **The Oracles (Quantum & Plato):**
    -   Productionize the AI logic for the **Quantum Oracle** (financial simulation) and the **Quantum Weaver** (business plan analysis), ensuring they are helpful and reliable.
    -   Build the initial version of **Plato's Intelligence Suite** for the Transactions view.
4.  **AI Governance (The Council of Conscience):**
    -   Establish the AI Ethics Council to review all new intelligent features for fairness, bias, and transparency.
    -   Implement a formal process for "Red Teaming" our AI features to thoughtfully consider potential misuse or unintended consequences.

### III. Architectural Philosophy
-   **GPU Infrastructure:** Secure a dedicated cluster of GPU instances for future work on fine-tuning and hosting our own specialized, efficient models.
-   **Vector Database:** Deploy a production-grade vector database (like Pinecone or Weaviate) to support future features requiring semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
-   **Prompt Engineering Framework:** Develop an internal framework for A/B testing prompts to systematically improve their helpfulness.
-   **Model Registry:** Use a tool like MLflow to track all our model experiments, versions, and artifacts, ensuring our work is transparent and reproducible.

### IV. Team Expansion (+10 FTEs)
-   **AI Platform Team (6):**
    -   4 Senior ML Engineers (specializing in MLOps and LLM infrastructure)
    -   2 Senior Software Engineers (to build and maintain our `ai-gateway`)
-   **AI Research (2):**
    -   2 AI Research Scientists (to focus on long-term R&D)
-   **AI Governance (2):**
    -   1 AI Ethicist / Responsible AI Lead
    -   1 AI Product Manager
