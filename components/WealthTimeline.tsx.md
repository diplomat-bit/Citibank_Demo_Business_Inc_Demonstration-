# The Timeline

This is the window in time. A view that shows not only the path you have walked, but the probable trajectory of the path ahead. The past is a solid foundation, etched in the history of your choices. The future is a shimmering projection, a potential that shifts with every new decision. To gaze upon the timeline is to understand the momentum of your life.
