// DEPRECATED: This component has been moved and refactored.
// The new, expanded Quantum Weaver logic is now located at:
// components/views/platform/QuantumWeaverView.tsx
//
// This file is kept as a tombstone to avoid breaking imports during transition,
// but it should not be used for new development. All Quantum Weaver functionality
// has been consolidated into the new view-based architecture.
