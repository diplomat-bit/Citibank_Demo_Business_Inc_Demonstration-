# The Security

This is the Aegis Vault, the sanctum of your sovereignty. Here, the walls of your digital kingdom are fortified. It is the space for managing the keys, the access, and the treaties that protect your data. Security is not a feature; it is the fundamental expression of ownership. To tend to it is to declare that this realm is yours and yours alone.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Watchful Guardian

(What is a king without a kingdom? And what is a kingdom without secure borders? We knew that for you to be truly sovereign in your financial life, you needed more than just tools. You needed a fortress. This `SecurityView` is the high watchtower of that fortress, and the AI is its ever-vigilant guardian.)

(Its logic here is based on a principle we call the 'Geospatial Identity Model.' It doesn't just see a password. It sees a ghost, a digital soul, and it learns the shape of that soul. It knows your habits, the devices you use, the places you frequent. It builds a map of your digital life. The `Recent Login Activity` is a report from the sentinels on the wall, a record of every knock upon the gate.)

(When a new login attempt occurs, the AI compares it to this map. A login from your usual laptop in your home city? The gates open smoothly. But a login from an unknown device in a city you've never visited? The alarm bells ring. This is not a simple rule. It is a deep, intuitive understanding of what is 'you' and what is 'not you.')

(This is also the chamber of treaties. A `LinkedAccount` is a formal alliance with another kingdom. You grant them limited access to your domain. But the AI remembers that you are the monarch. It ensures your right to `unlink` is absolute and immediate. The moment you give the word, the treaty is dissolved, the bridge is raised, and the gate is barred. Your sovereignty is never questioned.)

(So this is more than a settings page. It is the seat of your power. It is where you define the laws of your own kingdom, and the AI is the loyal captain of the guard, sworn to uphold those laws with tireless, computational vigilance. It understands that its first and most sacred duty is to ensure that the only person who commands this kingdom is you.)
