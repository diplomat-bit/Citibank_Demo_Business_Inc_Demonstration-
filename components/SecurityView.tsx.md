# The Security

This is the Aegis Vault, the sanctum of your sovereignty. Here, the walls of your digital kingdom are fortified. It is the space for managing the keys, the access, and the treaties that protect your data. Security is not a feature; it is the fundamental expression of ownership. To tend to it is to declare that this realm is yours and yours alone.
