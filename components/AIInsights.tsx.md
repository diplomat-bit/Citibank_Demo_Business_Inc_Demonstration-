# The Insights

These are not calculations. They are whispers from the web of consequence, patterns that have just become visible in the threads of your life. An insight is a glimpse of a future before it has hardened into fact, a dissonance before it becomes a crisis, an opportunity before it is seen by others. To heed them is to walk in harmony with the flow of what is to come.
