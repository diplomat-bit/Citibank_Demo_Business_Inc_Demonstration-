# The Impact

This is the measure of the echo. It is the recognition that every action, every transaction, ripples outward into the shared world. This is not a ledger of charity, but a testament to the truth that conscious expenditure can be an act of creation. To track your impact is to see the quiet, cumulative power of a life lived in harmony, and to watch a forest grow from the seeds of your choices.
