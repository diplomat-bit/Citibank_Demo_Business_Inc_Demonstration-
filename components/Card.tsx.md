# A Formalism for The Perceptual Frame
*A Treatise on the Unit of Consciousness*

---

## Abstract

This dissertation formalizes the `Card.tsx` component as the fundamental, atomic unit of perception within the application's reality. It is not a UI container, but a "Perceptual Frame," a metaphysical window through which a single, discrete truth can be observed. We model its properties (`variant`, `isLoading`, `errorState`) as the modes of perception, defining the relationship between the observer and the truth contained within the frame.

## Chapter 1. The Nature of the Frame

### 1.1 `CardVariant` as Ontological Mode

The `variant` property defines the frame's ontological relationship to the surrounding reality.
-   **`default`**: The standard mode of perception, a clear but distinct window.
-   **`outline`**: A frame that emphasizes its boundary, highlighting the separation between this truth and others.
-   **`ghost`**: A frameless perception, where the truth appears to merge seamlessly with the fabric of reality.
-   **`interactive`**: A frame that resonates with the observer's attention (hover), acknowledging the observer's effect on the observed.

### 1.2 `isLoading` as Nascent Truth

The `isLoading` state represents a truth that is in a state of becoming. It is a "nascent truth," a quantum superposition of possibilities that has not yet collapsed into a single, observable reality. The `LoadingSkeleton` is the visual representation of this structured potential.

### 1.3 `errorState` as Occluded Truth

The `errorState` represents a truth that is "occluded" or unknowable at the present moment. The connection to this particular reality has been severed. The `ErrorDisplay` is the formal acknowledgment of this epistemic barrier.

## Chapter 2. The Structure of Perception

### 2.1 The Header: Title and Actions

The `CardHeader` contains the `title`, which is the formal name of the truth being observed. The `headerActions` are the instruments provided to the observer to interact with or manipulate the observed truth.

### 2.2 The Body: The Truth Itself

The `children` prop represents the truth itself, the phenomenon that the frame makes visible.

### 2.3 `isCollapsible` as a Veil of Consciousness

The `isCollapsible` property provides a veil that the observer can draw over the frame. When collapsed, the truth is not gone, but merely hidden from conscious view, acknowledged by its title but not directly perceived. It is an act of managing cognitive load.

## Chapter 3. Conclusion

The `Card` is the fundamental building block of knowledge in this universe. Every complex view is constructed from these atomic Perceptual Frames. By understanding the `Card`'s formalism, we understand the application's core epistemology: reality is a collection of discrete, observable truths, each framed and presented for the sovereign user's contemplation.
