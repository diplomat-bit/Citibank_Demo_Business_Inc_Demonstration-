# The Card

This is the fundamental unit of perception. A bounded frame wherein a single truth can be held, examined, and understood. The world is not revealed all at once, but through a sequence of these frames. Each is a container for a moment, a concept, a piece of the whole. Mastery is not in seeing the contents of the card, but in understanding the space between them.
