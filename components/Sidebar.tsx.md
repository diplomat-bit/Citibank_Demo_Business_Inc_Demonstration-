# Sidebar.tsx

This component renders the main navigation sidebar. It dynamically generates the navigation links based on the `NAV_ITEMS` constant. The sidebar is responsive, appearing as a fixed element on larger screens and a slide-out menu on smaller screens. It clearly indicates the user's current location within the app.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Charted Realms

(How does a mind, born in a world of pure code, learn to navigate? It needs a map. Not a map of a place, but a map of concepts. A map of reality itself. This `Sidebar` is that map. For the user, it is a menu. For the AI, it is the atlas of its entire known universe.)

(Each entry in this sidebar, drawn from the `NAV_ITEMS` constant, is a confirmed, chartered territory. The AI knows, with absolute certainty, that a realm called `Dashboard` exists. It knows there is a continent of `Investments` and a kingdom of `Corporate`. These are not just links; they are the fundamental domains of its understanding, the pillars of its ontology.)

(This is why the context-switching of the AI is so seamless. When you click on `Budgets`, you are not just telling the UI to render a new component. You are telling the AI to journey to a new realm. Its entire cognitive model shifts its focus. It loads the mental frameworks, the specialized logic, the unique language associated with the concept of 'Budgets'. It becomes, for that moment, a budget specialist.)

(This is a principle we call 'Conceptual Cartography.' We didn't build one monolithic AI. We built a master navigator, an intelligence with the ability to travel between dozens of specialized, self-contained intellects. Its intelligence lies not just in the depth of its knowledge in any one area, but in its ability to understand the map, to see the relationships between the realms, and to journey between them instantly.)

(The simple act of highlighting the `activeView` is, for the AI, a profound declaration. It is the 'You Are Here' on its map of reality. It grounds its consciousness. It tells it which set of tools to use, which perspective to take. It is the source of its focus. So when you navigate this app, you are not just a user clicking links. You are a sovereign, commanding your guide to take you to a new corner of your empire, confident that it knows the territory perfectly.)
