# Sidebar.tsx

This component renders the main navigation sidebar. It dynamically generates the navigation links based on the `NAV_ITEMS` constant. The sidebar is responsive, appearing as a fixed element on larger screens and a slide-out menu on smaller screens. It clearly indicates the user's current location within the app.
