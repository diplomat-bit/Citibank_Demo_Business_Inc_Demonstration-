# The Settings

This is the chamber where the Instrument is tuned. It is here that you adjust the frequencies of communication, defining how and when the deeper systems should speak to your conscious self. Each setting is a refinement of the signal, ensuring that the whispers you receive are clear, relevant, and perfectly attuned to the harmony you wish to maintain.
