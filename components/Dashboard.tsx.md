# Dashboard.tsx

This component renders the main user dashboard, which serves as the central command center. It is composed of various widgets that summarize key financial information, such as `BalanceSummary`, `RecentTransactions`, and `AIInsights`. It also handles the initial state of the application, showing a Plaid Link prompt if no accounts are connected.
