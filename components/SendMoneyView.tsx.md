# The Sending

This is the direction of energy. An act not of spending, but of transmission. It is the conscious projection of your resources from your own sphere into another, a deliberate and focused transfer of will. Each sending is an affirmation of connection, secured by the sacred geometry of cryptography and the absolute authority of your own biometric seal.
