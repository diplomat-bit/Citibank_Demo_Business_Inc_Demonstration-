# The Balance

This is the point of equilibrium. The still center around which all flows and energies revolve. It is not a static number, but a dynamic state of harmony between what is gathered and what is released. To understand the balance is to find the quiet fulcrum upon which the entire weight of your world rests, and to know, in that quiet, a profound and unshakable peace.
