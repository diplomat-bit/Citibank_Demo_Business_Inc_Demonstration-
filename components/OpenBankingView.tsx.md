This is the Chamber of Treaties. A solemn space where you, the sovereign, grant limited and specific access to your kingdom's data. Each connection is a formal alliance, a treaty forged not on trust, but on cryptographic proof. You are always in command, with the absolute power to form and dissolve these connections, ensuring your sovereignty remains inviolate.
