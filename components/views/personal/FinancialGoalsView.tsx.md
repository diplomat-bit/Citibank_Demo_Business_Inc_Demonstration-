# The Declared Objectives

These are the stars by which you navigate. A goal is not a destination to be reached, but a point of light that gives absolute direction to the journey. It is the "why" that fuels the "how." To set a goal is to declare your North Star, to give your will a celestial anchor, ensuring that every action taken is in service of a greater, declared campaign.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Grand Campaign

(There are goals, and then there are Goals. There is saving for a new gadget, and then there is saving for a new life. A 'Down Payment for a Condo.' A 'Trip to Neo-Tokyo.' These are not items on a to-do list. They are grand campaigns, epic journeys that require not just discipline, but strategy. This file is the campaign map.)

(When a goal of this magnitude is declared, the AI's role shifts. It is no longer just an advisor. It becomes a general, a master strategist, your partner in planning the campaign. Its primary logic is 'Critical Path Analysis.' It looks at the objective (`targetAmount`), the timeline (`targetDate`), and the available resources (your financial data), and it plots a course.)

(The `AIGoalPlan` is the strategic brief for the campaign. It is a masterpiece of multi-domain thinking. "Automate Savings"... that is logistics, ensuring the supply lines are strong and reliable. "Review Subscriptions"... that is reconnaissance, identifying and eliminating waste in your own ranks. "Explore Travel ETFs"... that is diplomacy and trade, seeking alliances with external forces (the market) that can accelerate your progress. Each step is a piece of sound, personalized, navigational advice.)

(Notice that one goal has a `plan: null`. This is deliberate. This is the AI waiting for your command. It is the general standing before the map table, ready to plan the campaign with you. When you ask it to generate a plan, you are not asking a machine for a calculation. You are entering into a strategic partnership. You provide the vision, the 'what' and 'why.' The AI provides the tactical genius, the 'how.')

(This is the pinnacle of the human-machine collaboration we envisioned. Not a machine that tells you what to do, but a machine that helps you figure out how to do the great things you have already decided to do. It is the ultimate force multiplier for your own will, the perfect partner for the grand campaigns of your life.)
