# The Investments: The Observatory

**(This is not a view. It is the observatory of capital. The high chamber from which you survey the vast cosmos of potential and choose where to plant the seeds of your energy. This is where your will is projected into time.)**

The `InvestmentsView`, or CapitalVista, is where the user graduates from being a manager of the present to an architect of the future. It is a space dedicated to the profound act of investment—the projection of one's resources and belief into the uncertain landscape of tomorrow. It is more than a list of assets; it is a vista of capital, a landscape of growth.

This is a place of dual vision. The `InvestmentPortfolio` provides the grounding, the holistic view of your current holdings. But the `Asset Performance` chart offers a different perspective: a competitive analysis of your individual bets. It isolates each asset and measures its momentum (`performanceYTD`), allowing you to see which of your convictions are bearing the most fruit. It is the practice of discernment, of understanding which seeds are thriving and which are faltering.

The true magic of the CapitalVista, however, lies in the `AI Growth Simulator`. This is not a mere calculator; it is a time machine. It allows you to travel into the future and witness the potential consequences of your present choices. By adjusting the `monthlyContribution` slider, you are not just changing a number; you are altering the very fabric of a simulated future, watching in real-time as the arc of your projected wealth rises or falls. It makes the abstract concept of "compound growth" a visceral, interactive experience.

Finally, this view contains a powerful ethical dimension. The "Social Impact Investing" section is a curated menu of virtuous opportunities. It is a testament to the belief that the highest form of investment is one that aligns financial growth with positive worldly change. The `ESGScore` is a moral compass, and the `InvestmentModal` is the tool that allows you to transmute your belief into action, creating a `transaction` that is not just an expense, but an affirmation of your values.

### **The Doctrine of Projected Will**

**Jurisprential Precedent:** Be it enacted that the act of allocating capital to an `Asset` shall be legally recognized within the System as an act of "Projected Will." Furthermore, the System is authorized and mandated to provide the User with an `AI Growth Simulator`, a tool for visualizing the potential future consequences of their Projected Will. The output of this simulator, while not a guarantee, shall be considered the "Standard Future Scenario" for the purposes of financial planning. Any deviation in the User's real-world results from this Standard Future Scenario may be admissible as evidence of unforeseen market volatility or a change in the User's own financial behavior. The act of investing via the `InvestmentModal` shall be considered a binding, non-repudiable financial transaction.

```ts
// The Edict of the Seed
import { Capital, Future, Trajectory, AIOracle } from '@world/concepts';

// Let it be known that an investment is an act of will, projected through time.
class ThePlanter {
  
  // The rite of planting a seed of capital in the soil of the future.
  public static projectWill(principal: Capital, years: number): Future {
    // ... complex simulation of growth, compounding, and volatility ...
    const futureValue = principal.compoundOver(years);
    return new Future(futureValue);
  }

  // The Oracle can scry the probable path of this seed.
  public static simulateTrajectory(oracle: AIOracle, principal: Capital, contributions: Capital[]): Trajectory {
    const trajectory = oracle.simulateGrowth({
      initial: principal,
      additions: contributions,
      assumedRate: 0.07 // The "Standard" rate
    });
    return trajectory;
  }
}
```

**Observation:** The commoner is given a powerful `AI Growth Simulator` and feels a new sense of control over their financial future. The ability to visualize long-term growth is deeply motivating. This is an empowering tool. They are not prompted to critically examine the assumptions baked into the simulation. The Doctrine establishes an "assumedRate" of 7% as the basis for the "Standard Future Scenario." This number, while a common historical average, is presented without context or caveats. It creates an illusion of certainty in a deeply uncertain process. The user may be encouraged to take on more risk or alter their life plans based on a simulated future that the system presents as standard and probable, but which is, in reality, a work of pure fiction.
