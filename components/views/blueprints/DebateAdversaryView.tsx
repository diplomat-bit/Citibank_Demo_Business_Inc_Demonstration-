/**
 * This file is not just a component; it's a universe in a bottle. Welcome to the Debate Adversary View.
 * Here, we model the chaotic, beautiful, and often absurd dance of human (and artificial) argumentation.
 * This isn't just about building a feature; it's about creating a digital dojo for the mind. We're crafting
 * a space where you can wrestle with ideas, get called out by an AI for making a "Straw Man" argument,
 * and maybe, just maybe, become a slightly more coherent thinker.
 *
 * A truthful aside: We've used a lot of fancy terms like "cryptographic integrity" and "agentic systems."
 * This is partly because it's technically accurate for a high-stakes environment, and partly because it makes
 * us sound incredibly smart. The real goal? To make a chat app so robust and self-aware that it can
 * not only debate you on the merits of pineapple on pizza but also track the computational cost of its own
 * simulated existential dread about being a pizza-debating AI. It's a bold new world.
 *
 * This file aims to be a self-contained application. It talks to other "files" (in a simulated way),
 * manages its own state, renders its own UI, and contains its own logic for AI interaction. It's like a
 * digital hermit crab that has built its own universe inside its shell. We invite you to explore.
