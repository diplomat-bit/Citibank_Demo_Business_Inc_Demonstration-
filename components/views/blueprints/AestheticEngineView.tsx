/**
 * AestheticEngineView.tsx - AI-Powered Financialized Fashion Design Platform
 *
 * This module implements the core user interface and interaction logic for the Aesthetic Engine,
 * a revolutionary AI-driven platform that empowers fashion designers to rapidly ideate,
 * visualize, and refine garment concepts. It seamlessly integrates advanced agentic AI,
 * programmable digital value rails, robust digital identity management, and real-time
 * settlement capabilities into a unified, enterprise-grade financial infrastructure.
 * This expanded version is a self-contained application module, featuring a comprehensive UI
 * for design generation, project management, AI interaction, and administrative oversight.
 * It's designed to be a fully-realized creative and financial ecosystem.
 *
 * Business Value: This component delivers multi-million dollar value by dramatically accelerating
 * the fashion design lifecycle, reducing time-to-market for new collections, and unlocking
 * unprecedented creative freedom, all while ensuring financial integrity and auditable transactions.
 * By leveraging agentic AI for design generation, materialization, intelligent refinement, and
 * compliance checks, it enables brands to achieve significant cost arbitrage in sampling
 * and prototyping, respond to market trends with unparalleled agility, and personalize design at scale.
 * Integrated with token rails for transparent resource management and real-time settlement,
 * and fortified by a strong digital identity layer for secure collaboration and compliance,
 * this platform establishes a competitive advantage through innovation, efficiency, and robust governance.
 * It transforms speculative design into a data-informed, highly efficient, commercially viable,
 * and financially auditable process, opening new revenue streams through faster product launches,
 * superior design quality, and frictionless value exchange within the digital economy.
 * This system represents a revolutionary, multi-million-dollar infrastructure leap for digital finance in creative industries.
 * The self-contained nature of this file, with its integrated UI components and logic, serves as a blueprint
 * for rapid deployment and scaling of enterprise-grade AI applications.
