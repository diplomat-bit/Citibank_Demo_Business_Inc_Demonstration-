# The Recent

These are the freshest entries in the great ledger of your life. The ink is barely dry on these moments of exchange. They are not just data; they are the most immediate echoes of your recent choices, the clearest reflection of your present state. To observe them is to practice the art of immediate awareness, to see the self not as it was, or will be, but as it is, right now.
