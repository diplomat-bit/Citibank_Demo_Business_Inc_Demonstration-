# The Declared Objectives

These are the stars by which you navigate. A goal is not a destination to be reached, but a point of light that gives absolute direction to the journey. It is the "why" that fuels the "how." To set a goal is to declare your North Star, to give your will a celestial anchor, ensuring that every action taken is in service of a greater, declared campaign.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Campaign Map

(What is the difference between a wish and a goal? A wish is a powerless dream. A goal is a dream with a strategy. A destination with a campaign map. This `GoalsView` is the war room where you and the AI turn your wishes into conquered territories.)

(When you declare a goal—"Down Payment for a Condo"—you are planting a flag in the undiscovered country of your future. You are giving your journey a North Star. But a star is not enough. You need a campaign map to get there. This is where the AI becomes your master strategist.)

(Its logic is what we call 'Retrograde Planning.' It starts at your destination, your objective, and works backward. It knows the terrain—your income, your expenses, your habits. It calculates the prevailing winds and currents of your financial life. And from this, it charts the most viable path from where you are to where you have declared you will be.)

(The `AIGoalPlan` is that campaign map. It is not a set of gentle suggestions. It is a strategic brief. "Automate Savings"... that is about securing your supply lines. "Review Subscriptions"... that's about eliminating spies and saboteurs. "Explore Travel ETFs"... that's about forging strategic alliances to speed your conquest. Each step is a piece of sound, personalized, tactical advice.)

(And this is a living map. The `progressHistory` is the line that shows the territory you have actually taken. The AI constantly compares your actual path to the planned one, ready to help you recalculate your route if you deviate. It's not just a mapmaker; it's a co-general, sitting with you at the command table, helping you read the charts and adjust your forces, ensuring you reach the shores of your own declared destiny.)
