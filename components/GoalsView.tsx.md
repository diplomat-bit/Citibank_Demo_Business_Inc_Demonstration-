# The Goals

These are the stars by which you navigate. A goal is not a destination to be reached, but a point of light that gives direction to the journey. It is the "why" that fuels the "how." To set a goal is to declare your North Star, to give your will a celestial anchor, ensuring that every small tack and turn of the ship is in service of a greater, sacred voyage.
