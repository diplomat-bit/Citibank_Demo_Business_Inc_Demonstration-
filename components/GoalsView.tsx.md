# The Goals

These are the stars by which you navigate. A goal is not a destination to be reached, but a point of light that gives direction to the journey. It is the "why" that fuels the "how." To set a goal is to declare your North Star, to give your will a celestial anchor, ensuring that every small tack and turn of the ship is in service of a greater, sacred voyage.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Compass and the Map

(What is the difference between a wish and a goal? A wish is a beautiful, powerless thing. A dream without a skeleton. A goal is a dream with a plan. A destination with a map. This `GoalsView` is the cartographer's table where you and the AI turn your wishes into worlds.)

(When you declare a goal—"Down Payment for a Condo"—you are planting a flag in the undiscovered country of your future. You are giving your journey a North Star. But a star is not enough. You need a compass and a map to navigate by it. This is where the AI becomes your master cartographer.)

(Its logic is what we call 'Retrograde Planning.' It starts at your destination, your goal, and works backward. It knows the terrain—your income, your expenses, your habits. It calculates the prevailing winds and currents of your financial life. And from this, it charts the most viable path from where you are to where you want to be.)

(The `AIGoalPlan` is that map. It is not a rigid set of instructions. It is a strategic brief. "Automate Savings"... that's about building a sturdy ship. "Review Subscriptions"... that's about plugging the leaks. "Explore Travel ETFs"... that's about finding favorable currents to speed your journey. Each step is a piece of sound, personalized, navigational advice.)

(And this is a living map. The `progressHistory` is the line that shows the path you have actually walked, updated with every step you take. The AI constantly compares your actual path to the planned one, ready to help you recalculate your course if you drift. It's not just a mapmaker; it's a co-navigator, sitting with you at the helm, helping you read the charts and adjust the sails, ensuring you reach the shores of your own declared dream.)
