// DEPRECATED: This component has been moved and refactored.
// The new, expanded AI Advisor logic is now located at:
// components/views/platform/AIAdvisorView.tsx
//
// This file is kept as a tombstone to avoid breaking imports during transition,
// but it should not be used for new development. All AI Advisor functionality
// has been consolidated into the new view-based architecture.
