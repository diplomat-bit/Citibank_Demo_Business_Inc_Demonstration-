# The Budgets

These are the Covenants of Spending, the self-imposed laws that give structure to your will. A budget is not a restriction; it is a declaration of intent. It is the architecture of discipline, the deliberate channeling of energy toward what is truly valued. To honor these covenants is to build a life where every expenditure is an affirmation of your deepest principles.
