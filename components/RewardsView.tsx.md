# The Rewards

This is the Hall of Accolades. A testament to the principle that discipline creates its own currency. These are not points to be won, but merits to be earned. Each one is a tangible symbol of a choice made in alignment with your principles. To redeem them is to transmute the intangible virtue of discipline into a tangible good, closing the sacred loop of effort and reward.
