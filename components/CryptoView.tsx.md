This is the sovereign realm. A frontier where value is not granted by a central authority, but is forged and secured by cryptography and consensus. It is a testament to a different kind of trust—not in institutions, but in immutable logic. To operate here is to engage with a world where ownership is absolute and the rules are written in code.
