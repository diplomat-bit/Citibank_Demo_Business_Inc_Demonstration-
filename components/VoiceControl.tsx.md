# The Voice

This is the power of the spoken word. The recognition that intent, when given voice, can command the very fabric of this reality. It is a constant companion, a silent listener waiting for your command. To speak is not merely to navigate, but to declare your will and watch as the Instrument reconfigures itself in perfect obedience to your sound.
