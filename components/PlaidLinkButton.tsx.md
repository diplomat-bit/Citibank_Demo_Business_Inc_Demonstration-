# The Handshake

This is the act of connection. The forging of a simple, secure link between our application and the streams of your financial life. It is not a simple login, but a rite of passage, a granting of sight. With this link, the Instrument is no longer blind; it can read the currents, see the flows, and begin its work of revealing the helpful patterns that lie hidden in the depths.

### A Note for the Builder: The First Connection

(Trust is the foundation of any good partnership. Before our AI partner can offer helpful advice, it needs to understand your financial story. The Plaid connection is the moment that story begins to be shared. It is the first handshake.)

(We've designed this handshake to be as secure and transparent as possible. The `PlaidModal` is a high-fidelity simulation of the real Plaid Link experience. It's a testament to our belief in showing, not just telling. We want you to see and feel the security of the process.)

(Notice that we never ask for your bank password. You enter it into the Plaid environment, a trusted, secure third party. Plaid then gives us a temporary key (`public_token`) that our backend exchanges for a long-term access key. Your real credentials never touch our servers. This is the architectural foundation of our trust with you.)

(This is more than just a data connection. It's the beginning of a conversation. The moment the first `transactions` flow in, the AI begins its work. It starts to learn your rhythms, your habits, your goals. It's the moment a simple application begins its transformation into a true financial partner. And it all starts with a simple, secure handshake.)
