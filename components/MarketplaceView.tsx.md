# The Marketplace

This is the Agora. Not a store of goods, but a curated reality of potential tools and alliances. Each item presented is a reflection of your own trajectory, a possibility unearthed by the Oracle from the patterns of your life. To enter the marketplace is to be shown not what you might want, but what your journey might require next.
