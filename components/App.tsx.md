# The Application

This is the vessel. Not the journey, but the space in which the journey occurs. It is the body that contains the consciousness, the temple that holds the altar. Its architecture defines the boundaries of the known world, but it does not dictate the path. It is the silent, ever-present container for the infinite potential of the builder within.
