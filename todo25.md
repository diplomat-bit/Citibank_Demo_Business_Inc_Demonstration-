# The Sovereign Codex - Go-Live Strategy, Phase V
## The Corporate Command Center

### I. Mission Directive
To construct the enterprise-grade suite of tools for our business clients. This phase expands the platform's scope from the Sovereign Individual to the Sovereign Organization. The objective is to build a powerful, integrated command center for managing corporate finance, demonstrating our capability to handle the complexity and security demands of B2B fintech.

### II. Key Strategic Objectives
1.  **Imperium Ops (Corporate Dashboard):**
    -   Develop the central dashboard for corporate users, featuring KPI cards for pending approvals, overdue invoices, and new anomalies.
    -   Integrate the "AI Controller Summary" to provide a high-level, actionable overview of the company's financial state.
2.  **Instruments of Delegated Will (Card Management):**
    -   Build the Corporate Card view, allowing admins to issue, freeze, and manage virtual and physical cards.
    -   Implement the AI-powered spend controls suggester.
3.  **The Chain of Command (Payment Orders):**
    -   Build the full payment order workflow system, including creation, multi-level approval chains, and status tracking.
4.  **The Chronicle of Broken Rhythms (Anomaly Detection):**
    -   Implement the Anomaly Detection view.
    -   Build the backend AI service that continuously scans transaction streams for patterns that deviate from the established norm for a given company or user.
5.  **Compliance & Invoicing:**
    -   Launch the initial versions of the Compliance Center and Invoices modules, focusing on case management and tracking.

### III. Product & Engineering Plan
-   **B2B Product Vertical:** Establish the second Product Vertical team, staffed with individuals experienced in B2B SaaS and fintech.
-   **Multi-Tenancy Architecture:** The core platform must be re-architected to support full multi-tenancy. This includes data isolation at the database level and a robust permissions model to handle corporate roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).
-   **Security & Compliance:**
    -   Begin the SOC 2 Type I audit process in parallel with development. All engineering work must be done with SOC 2 controls in mind (e.g., logging, change management, access control).
    -   The Anomaly Detection engine will be the first major production use case for our internal AI Platform, requiring close collaboration between the B2B and AI teams.
-   **API Integrations:** Build the backend services to support future integrations with key B2B systems like NetSuite, Salesforce, and Slack.

### IV. Team Expansion (+15 FTEs)
-   **Corporate Finance Product Vertical:**
    -   1 Senior Product Manager (B2B Fintech experience required)
    -   1 Senior Product Designer (Enterprise UX experience required)
    -   5 Senior Backend Engineers (experience with multi-tenancy and financial ledgers)
    -   4 Senior Frontend Engineers
    -   2 QA Engineers
-   **Security & Compliance (2):**
    -   1 Security Compliance Manager (to lead SOC 2 audit)
    -   1 Application Security Engineer
