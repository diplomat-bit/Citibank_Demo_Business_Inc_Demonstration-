# Go-Live Strategy, Phase V
## The Business Co-Pilot

### I. Mission Directive
To build our suite of tools for business clients, expanding our focus from helping individuals to helping teams collaborate. The goal is to create a powerful, integrated, and friendly platform for managing company finances, demonstrating that business software can be both capable and human-centered.

### II. Key Strategic Objectives
1.  **The Dashboard (The Business Compass):**
    -   Develop the central dashboard for business users, featuring clear, actionable cards for things like pending approvals and overdue invoices.
    -   Integrate the "AI Controller Summary" to provide a high-level, plain-English overview of the company's financial health.
2.  **Card Management (The Team Wallet):**
    -   Build the Corporate Card view, allowing admins to easily issue, freeze, and manage virtual and physical cards for their team.
    -   Implement the AI-powered spend controls suggester to provide helpful defaults.
3.  **Payment Orders (The Approval Flow):**
    -   Build a simple and transparent payment approval system, including creation, multi-level approvals, and status tracking.
4.  **Anomaly Detection (The Watchful Friend):**
    -   Implement the Anomaly Detection view.
    -   Build the backend AI service that continuously looks for spending patterns that seem unusual for a company or user, offering a gentle heads-up.
5.  **Compliance & Invoicing:**
    -   Launch the first versions of the Compliance Center and Invoices modules, focusing on clear case management and tracking.

### III. Product & Engineering Plan
-   **B2B Product Vertical:** Form our second Product Vertical team, bringing together people with a passion for making business tools that are a joy to use.
-   **Multi-Tenancy Architecture:** We will thoughtfully architect our core platform to support multiple teams securely. This includes ensuring data is private to each company and building a flexible permissions model for different roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).
-   **Security & Compliance:**
    -   We will begin the SOC 2 Type I audit process as we build, weaving security and compliance into the fabric of our code from the start.
    -   The Anomaly Detection engine will be a key feature for our internal AI Platform, built in close collaboration between the B2B and AI teams.
-   **API Integrations:** Build the foundational services that will allow us to connect with key business systems like NetSuite, Salesforce, and Slack in the future.
