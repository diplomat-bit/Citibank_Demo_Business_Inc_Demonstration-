# James Lang powered by #U

This is a self-contained, AI-powered module designed to provide core JavaScript global functionalities without any external dependencies. It's built from the ground up to be a standalone solution.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Globals**: Leverages advanced AI to provide robust and intelligent global object emulation.
*   **Zero Dependencies**: No external libraries or packages are required.
*   **Standalone Operation**: Runs independently in any JavaScript environment.

## Usage

Since this module has no dependencies, you can integrate its functionalities directly into your project. The specific implementation details will depend on how you choose to incorporate the AI-powered global logic.

For example, you might:

1.  Copy and paste the core AI logic into your project.
2.  Use a build process to inline the code.

The goal is to have a completely self-sufficient global environment powered by James Lang and #U.
