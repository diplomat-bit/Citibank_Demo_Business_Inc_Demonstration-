# The Sovereign Codex - Integration Plan, Part 18/10
## Module Integrations: The Business Operations Suite

This document provides the exhaustive, code-complete integration plan for the core business operations modules: **Communications**, **Commerce**, **Teams**, **CMS**, **LMS**, and **HRIS**.

---

## 1. Commerce Module: The Merchant's Guild
### Core Concept
To provide a full-featured e-commerce experience, the Commerce module must integrate with a leading payment processor and a headless commerce platform.

### Key API Integrations

#### a. Shopify Storefront API (GraphQL)
- **Purpose:** Fetch product catalogs, manage shopping carts, and create checkouts using Shopify's backend, while maintaining a completely custom frontend within the Demo Bank Commerce module.
- **Architectural Approach:** The frontend will directly query the Shopify Storefront GraphQL API. This is secure because the Storefront API uses a public token that only allows read-access to products and creation of carts/checkouts.
- **Code Examples:**
  - **TypeScript (Frontend Service - Fetching Products):**
    ```typescript
    // services/shopify_client.ts
    import axios from 'axios';

    const SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN = process.env.SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN;
    const SHOPIFY_GRAPHQL_URL = `https://your-store.myshopify.com/api/2023-07/graphql.json`;

    const getProductsQuery = `
      query GetProducts {
        products(first: 10) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              title
              handle
              priceRange {
                minVariantPrice {
                  amount
                }
              }
              images(first: 1) {
                edges {
                  node {
                    url
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `;

    export async function fetchShopifyProducts() {
      const response = await axios.post(SHOPIFY_GRAPHQL_URL, {
        query: getProductsQuery,
      }, {
        headers: {
          'X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token': SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        }
      });
      return response.data.data.products.edges;
    }
    ```

---

## 2. CMS Module: The Scribe's Hall
### Core Concept
The CMS module will integrate with a headless CMS to manage and deliver content, allowing marketing teams to use a best-in-class editor while developers consume the content via API.

### Key API Integrations

#### a. Contentful API
- **Purpose:** Fetch content entries (blog posts, pages, etc.) from Contentful to be displayed within Demo Bank.
- **Architectural Approach:** The backend service will use the Contentful SDK to fetch published content. This allows for server-side rendering and caching, improving performance and SEO.
- **Code Examples:**
  - **Python (Backend Service - Fetching Blog Posts):**
    ```python
    # services/contentful_client.py
    import contentful
    import os

    SPACE_ID = os.environ.get('CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID')
    DELIVERY_API_KEY = os.environ.get('CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_API_KEY')

    client = contentful.Client(SPACE_ID, DELIVERY_API_KEY)

    def get_blog_posts():
        """ Fetches all entries of the 'blogPost' content type. """
        entries = client.entries({
            'content_type': 'blogPost',
            'order': '-fields.publishDate'
        })
        return entries
    ```

---

## 3. LMS Module: The Great Library
### Core Concept
The LMS module will integrate with external course providers to offer a wider catalog of learning materials to employees.

### Key API Integrations

#### a. Udemy API
- **Purpose:** Search Udemy's vast course library and display relevant courses within the Demo Bank LMS.
- **Architectural Approach:** A backend service will securely call the Udemy API to search for courses. The results will be displayed in our UI, and a purchase link would direct the user to Udemy.
- **Code Examples:**
  - **TypeScript (Backend Service - Searching Courses):**
    ```typescript
    // services/udemy_client.ts
    import axios from 'axios';

    const UDEMY_CLIENT_ID = process.env.UDEMY_CLIENT_ID;
    const UDEMY_CLIENT_SECRET = process.env.UDEMY_CLIENT_SECRET;
    const credentials = Buffer.from(`${UDEMY_CLIENT_ID}:${UDEMY_CLIENT_SECRET}`).toString('base64');

    export async function searchUdemyCourses(query: string) {
        const response = await axios.get('https://www.udemy.com/api-2.0/courses/', {
            headers: {
                'Authorization': `Basic ${credentials}`
            },
            params: {
                search: query,
                page_size: 10,
            }
        });
        return response.data.results;
    }
    ```

## 4. HRIS Module: The Roster of Souls
### Core Concept
The HRIS module will act as a central hub, syncing employee data from a primary HR platform like Workday to ensure all other internal systems have an up-to-date employee roster.

### Key API Integrations

#### a. Workday API
- **Purpose:** Fetch employee directory information, including name, role, department, and manager.
- **Architectural Approach:** A scheduled backend job will connect to the Workday SOAP or REST API to get a list of all active employees. It will then update the internal Demo Bank employee database, adding new hires and deactivating termed employees.
- **Code Examples:**
  - **Python (Backend Service - Syncing Employees):**
    ```python
    # services/workday_sync.py
    # NOTE: Workday APIs are complex and often use SOAP. This is a conceptual REST example.
    import requests

    WORKDAY_TENANT_URL = "https://your-tenant.workday.com"
    # Assumes OAuth 2.0 token is managed securely
    WORKDAY_TOKEN = "..."

    def get_active_employees():
        endpoint = f"{WORKDAY_TENANT_URL}/api/v1/workers"
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {WORKDAY_TOKEN}"}
        
        response = requests.get(endpoint, headers=headers, params={"active": "true"})
        response.raise_for_status()

        # Logic to parse the response and map Workday fields to our internal Employee model
        employees = response.json()['data']
        print(f"Synced {len(employees)} active employees from Workday.")
        return employees
    ```

### UI/UX Integration
- The **Commerce** UI will look and feel native to Demo Bank, but the product listings and checkout process will be powered by Shopify in the background.
- The **CMS** module will have a "Content Sources" area where users can connect their Contentful space.
- The **LMS** will have a tab for "Internal Courses" and "External Courses (Udemy)".
- The **HRIS** module's employee directory will have a small "Synced from Workday" indicator with a timestamp of the last sync.
