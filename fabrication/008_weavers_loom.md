### Concept

A small, elegant desktop CNC machine or 3D printer that directly integrates with the creative modules of the Instrument. When the Aesthetic Engine or another design tool generates a CAD file, the user can send it directly to the Loom to fabricate a physical prototype, closing the loop from digital idea to physical object.
