### Concept

A handheld, pocket-sized device made of smooth, dark stone that provides silent, haptic feedback for high-urgency notifications from the Sovereign's Ledger. It does not have a screen. It communicates only through warmth and subtle, complex vibrations. It is a tool for receiving critical signals without the distraction of a visual interface.
