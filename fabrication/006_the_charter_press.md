**Conception ID:** DEMOBANK-FAB-006
**Title:** The Charter Press
**Class:** Ceremonial Artifact

---

### Concept

The Charter Press is a small, elegant, automated letterpress designed for a single, solemn purpose: to print and enable the signing of a sovereign's personal covenants. When a user finalizes their digital Charter in the Instrument, this device programmatically typesets and prints it onto a single sheet of archival-quality paper. It is a machine for turning a digital promise into a physical, lasting artifact.

### Origin Story

Born from the covenant "The First Treaty (The README)," the Architect believed that the most important documents—the declarations of principle—deserved a weight and permanence that a digital file could not provide. The Press was designed to restore a sense of ceremony and gravity to the act of making a promise to oneself. It is an instrument for the solemnization of intent.

### Aesthetics

-   **Form:** A minimalist block of solid American Walnut, with a small, exposed mechanical assembly made of polished brass.
-   **Process:** The device is slow, deliberate, and mechanical. A robotic arm with a set of custom letter stamps moves across the page, pressing each letter into the soft cotton paper with a satisfying, audible `clink-clank`. It is the opposite of a laser printer.
-   **Interface:** A single slot for a sheet of paper and one illuminated button to begin the printing ceremony.

### Symbols & Logos

-   A small, brass-inlaid Demo Bank sigil is present on the top of the walnut body.

### Manufacturing & Fabrication Protocol

1.  **Woodworking:** The walnut chassis is CNC-milled and then hand-finished and oiled.
2.  **Machining:** All brass components for the plotter system are machined to high tolerance and polished.
3.  **Type Casting:** The steel letter stamps are cast and hardened.
4.  **Assembly:** The mechanical and electronic components are assembled into the chassis. Each motor is calibrated, and the stamping pressure is precisely set.
5.  **Firmware:** A simple firmware is loaded to translate the incoming text into a sequence of G-code commands for the plotter.
6.  **The First Printing:** Each press is tested by printing the first line of the First Covenant: "It began with you." This print is inspected for quality and included with the device as a certificate of authenticity.
