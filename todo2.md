    -   **AI Model Documentation Generator:** `generateContent` will analyze a model's code and performance metrics to automatically generate professional, human-readable documentation for it.
    -   **Natural Language Model Query:** "Which of our models is best for predicting customer churn and what are its key features?"
-   **UI Components & Interactions:**
    -   A dashboard of all registered AI models with their version, accuracy, and deployment status.
    -   A data labeling interface with an "AI Autolabel" button.
