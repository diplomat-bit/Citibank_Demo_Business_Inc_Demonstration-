# The Constants: The Tablets of Immutable Law

**(This is not a file of variables. It is a tablet of stone, upon which are inscribed the immutable truths of this reality. These are the fixed principles and sacred symbols upon which the world is built. They do not change.)**

Herein lie the laws of the physics of this universe. The `NAV_ITEMS` are not a mere list of links; they are the charted constellations of the known world, the fixed stars by which the `Sidebar` navigates. Their order and being are pre-ordained, a map of all that is and all that can be explored. To add a new constant here is not to add a feature; it is to discover a new continent.

The `Icon` components are the sacred glyphs, the sigils that represent the fundamental forces and realms. A `DashboardIcon` is not an image; it is the very essence of "Dashboard" given visual form. These symbols are imbued with an intrinsic meaning that is recognized and respected by all other components in the system. They are the heraldry of the Instrument's kingdom.

Unlike the fluid, ever-changing data that flows from the `DataContext`, the values here are eternal. They are the bedrock, the unchanging axioms that provide structure and meaning to all that is dynamic. They are the quiet, steady hum beneath the symphony of user activity. While the user's balance may rise and fall, the very *idea* of the Dashboard, represented by its constant, remains.

This is a declaration of what is permanent. It is a testament to the fact that even in a world of endless flux, there must be fixed points. There must be laws. There must be principles that hold true regardless of the user's state or the passage of time. These constants are that foundation. They are the quiet reassurance that no matter how chaotic the user's financial life may seem, the structure of the world that contains it is stable, predictable, and unchanging.

To understand the constants is to understand the fundamental physics of the Instrument. It is to know the difference between the weather and the mountains. The data is the weather, ever-shifting. The constants are the mountains, and they do not move.

### **The Doctrine of Immutability**

**Jurisprential Precedent:** Be it decreed and forever established that all entities declared within this `constants.tsx` codex are to be considered immutable truths, existing outside the normal flow of time and state. They are held to be *per se* (in themselves) valid and unalterable. No function, component, or user action shall possess the legal authority to modify, overwrite, or otherwise abrogate these declared constants. Any attempt to do so constitutes an act of metaphysical rebellion against the established order of the universe and shall be rejected *ab initio* by the runtime judiciary (the JavaScript engine). These constants represent the *de jure* framework of the application's reality, and their immutability is the ultimate guarantee of the system's stability and predictability. They are not variables subject to the law; they *are* the law.

```ts
// The Edict of Permanence
import { Reality, UserAction } from '@world/engine';

// Let it be known that some truths are eternal.
export const THE_REALM_OF_DASHBOARD: 'dashboard' = 'dashboard';
export const THE_GLYPH_OF_DASHBOARD: Icon = new Icon('<path...>');

// Any action that seeks to alter an immutable truth is, by definition, an illegal act.
function attemptToAlterReality(action: UserAction, reality: Reality): void {
  // Trying to change a constant is like trying to change the law of gravity.
  // The universe itself prevents it.
  if (action.target === THE_REALM_OF_DASHBOARD && action.type === 'RENAME') {
    // The JavaScript engine, as the ultimate enforcer of this law,
    // will throw a TypeError, the highest form of judicial rebuke.
    throw new TypeError(
      'Illegal attempt to modify a constant. The laws of this reality are not subject to change.'
    );
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Observation:** The commoner is told that these constants provide stability and predictability, which is a great comfort. They are shown a world with fixed, reliable laws. They are not encouraged to ask who wrote these laws, or why these specific laws were chosen over others. The immutability of the law is presented as a feature, a sign of its perfection. It is not presented as what it also is: a fundamental limitation on the user's ability to change the most basic structures of their own world. They are sovereign, but only within the unchangeable cage of the laws they were given.
