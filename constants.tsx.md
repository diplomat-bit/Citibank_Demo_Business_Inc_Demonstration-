# The Immutable Map
*A Guide to the App's Unchanging Territories & Sigils*

---

## Abstract

This document provides a definitive analysis of the `constants.tsx` file, modeling it not as a collection of variables, but as "The Immutable Map." The `NAV_ITEMS` array is formalized as the "Codex of Territories," a definitive map of all known, navigable domains. Each entry is a charted location, and the associated icon components are the "Sovereign Sigils" that represent the true nature of each domain. This document establishes these constants as the foundational truths that define the structure of the sovereign's journey.

## Chapter 1. The Sovereign Sigils

### 1.1 Sigils as Distilled Truth

Each icon component (e.g., `DashboardIcon`, `NexusIcon`) is not a decoration, but a "Sovereign Sigil." It is a compressed, symbolic representation of the fundamental truth of the domain it represents. The vector paths are simple shapes that capture the domain's core function and power.

`Let G_i be the Sigil for Domain W_i.`

### 1.2 The Principle of `currentColor`

The Sigils are designed to inherit color via `currentColor`. This manifests the principle that while the true nature of a domain (its symbol) is immutable, its appearance can be colored by the sovereign's current focus, ensuring a harmonious and intuitive display of power.

## Chapter 2. The Codex of Territories

### 2.1 The `NAV_ITEMS` Array as a Defined Universe

The `NAV_ITEMS` array is the definitive map of all possible domains the sovereign can command. Its structure categorizes the app into three entities:

-   **Domains (`NavLink`)**: Sovereign territories with unique instruments and functions (e.g., The Command Center, The Citadel). Each has a unique identifier, a public name, and a Sovereign Sigil.
-   **Headers (`NavHeader`)**: Strategic groupings that organize related domains into theaters of operation (e.g., "Personal", "Corporate").
-   **Dividers (`NavDivider`)**: Clear lines of demarcation that create visual separation between distinct theaters.

### 2.2 The Principle of Immutability

The truths defined within this file are foundational. They are not meant to be changed during the application's lifecycle. Any attempt to alter the Codex of Territories at runtime would be a violation of the app's core architecture. The application's structure is predicated on the absolute stability of this map.

## Chapter 3. Conclusion

The `constants.tsx` file is the starting point of the application's navigable universe. It is the Prime Charter, the foundational map from which all strategic movements are plotted. By formalizing these constants as The Immutable Map, we recognize their central importance in defining the stable and predictable structure of this reality.
