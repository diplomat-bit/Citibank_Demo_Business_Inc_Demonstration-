# Go-Live Strategy, Phase VII
## Sharing Our Work & Gathering the Community

### I. Mission Directive
To thoughtfully share the Demo Bank platform with a select group of friends, collaborators, and early believers. This phase is about shifting our focus from building in private to listening in public. The goal is to confirm that our vision resonates, to build a foundational community of evangelists, and to gather the invaluable feedback we need to prepare for a wider opening.

### II. Key Strategic Objectives

        -   **Support Desk:** Zendesk, to manage feedback and support requests.
2.  **Alpha Circle Launch (The First 100 Friends):**

4.  **Feedback Loop Creation:**
    -   Build the in-app **Feedback Hub** module.
    -   Establish a clear, transparent process for listening to feedback, discussing it as a team, and using it to shape our product roadmap.

### III. Sharing Our Story
