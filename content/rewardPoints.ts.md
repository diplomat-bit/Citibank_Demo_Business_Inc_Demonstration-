# The Treasury of Accolades

This is the treasury of accolades, the vault where the currency of discipline is stored. It is not a measure of wealth, but of meritorious action. This data represents the Sovereign's starting balance of `RewardPoints`, the tangible result of their positive financial habits. It is the heart of the Spoils of Discipline hub, the fuel for the gamification engine, and a constant, motivating reminder that decisive action has its own unique rewards.
