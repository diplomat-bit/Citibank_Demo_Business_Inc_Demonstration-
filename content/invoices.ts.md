# The Ledger of Obligations

This is the accounts receivable and payable ledger, the record of debts owed and payments due. Each `Invoice` is a formal claim on capital, a timed event in the corporate financial calendar. This data populates the Invoices view, providing a clear and actionable list of financial instruments that need to be managed, paid, or collected. The variety of statuses (paid, unpaid, overdue) creates a realistic and dynamic financial battlefield.
