**Conception ID:** DEMOBANK-FAB-005
**Title:** The Aegis Node
**Class:** Decentralized Security Instrument

---

### Concept

The Aegis Node is a physical piece of The Citadel, a home server designed for data sovereignty. It creates an encrypted, peer-to-peer network with the user's other devices (and optionally, trusted family members), storing redundant, sharded copies of their most critical data. It is a physical manifestation of data ownership, a piece of the fortress brought into the home, designed to run silently and forever.

### Origin Story

Conceived as the ultimate expression of the "Aegis of the Workshop" and "Zero Trust" covenants, the Node was designed to solve the paradox of the cloud: convenience at the cost of control. The Architect envisioned a "personal cloud" that was truly personal—a decentralized, resilient network owned and controlled by the sovereign and their chosen allies, not a distant corporation.

### Aesthetics

-   **Form:** A perfect 10cm cube of solid, bead-blasted 6061-T6 aluminum. It is entirely seamless, with no visible ports or screws.
-   **Material:** Anodized in a deep, matte black. It is cool to the touch and has a reassuring heft.
-   **Interface:** A single, slow-pulsing cyan light emanates from a pinhole on one face, indicating its health and connection to the network. The light's rhythm changes subtly to indicate activity. It is powered inductively.

### Symbols & Logos

-   The Demo Bank sigil is subtly laser-etched on the bottom of the device, visible only upon close inspection.

### Specifications

-   **Dimensions:** 100mm x 100mm x 100mm
-   **Weight:** 2.2 kg
-   **Chassis:** Monobody, CNC-milled aluminum.
-   **Processor:** Low-power ARM-based SoC (System on a Chip).
-   **Storage:** 2TB of solid-state, industrial-grade storage with hardware encryption.
-   **Secure Element:** EAL 7+ Certified Secure Enclave for key storage and cryptographic operations, including firmware for behavioral biometric models.
-   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet (via inductive port adapter), Inductive Power (Qi+).
-   **Cooling:** Passively cooled by the aluminum chassis.

### Manufacturing & Fabrication Protocol

1.  **Chassis Milling:** Each chassis is milled from a solid block of aluminum. The interior is precisely hollowed out to act as a heat sink for the internal components.
2.  **Anodization:** The finished chassis is anodized and laser-etched.
3.  **Board Assembly:** The mainboard, storage, and secure enclave are assembled and tested as a single unit.
4.  **Final Assembly:** The board is installed, and thermal pads are applied to bond it to the chassis for heat dissipation. The inductive power coil is installed.
5.  **Firmware Flash & Sealing:** The initial, signed firmware is flashed onto the secure enclave. The final face of the cube is then bonded in place with aerospace-grade adhesive and cured, making the unit permanently sealed.
6.  **Network Provisioning:** The device is powered on in a secure environment and provisions itself, generating its unique cryptographic identity and registering with the Aegis network.
