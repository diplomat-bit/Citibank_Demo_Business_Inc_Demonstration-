### Concept

A physical controller with a set of high-precision, weighted brass dials and sliders. It connects to the Economic Synthesis Engine, allowing the sovereign to manipulate the parameters of a simulation (interest rates, fiscal spending) with the tactile feedback of a physical instrument. It transforms the act of economic modeling into a haptic, intuitive experience.
