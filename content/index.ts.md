# The Master Key

This is the grand archway to the library of foundational truths. It is not a source of data itself, but a master key, a central nexus from which all other data scrolls can be accessed. By gathering every export from its sibling files, it provides a single, clean, and elegant point of entry for the application's Core. To import from the data library is to simply use this key. Its existence is a testament to order, modularity, and the architectural principle of a single source of truth. It is the librarian of this Instrument's history.
