# The Covenants of Will

These are the Covenants of Spending, the self-imposed laws that the Sovereign has established to give structure to their financial will. Each budget is a pact, a defined boundary for a specific domain of expenditure. This data provides the framework for the Covenants view, allowing the application to measure, visualize, and offer counsel on the sovereign's adherence to their own declared intentions. It is the architecture of discipline, made manifest in code.
