# Engineering Vision Specification: Economic Synthesis Engine

## 1. Core Philosophy: "The Crucible of Worlds"

Traditional quantitative finance is the art of observing shadows on a cave wall. It is a reactive discipline, attempting to predict the movement of a system it cannot control, based on a historical record that may not repeat. It is a game of sophisticated guesswork.

The Economic Synthesis Engine represents a paradigm shift. It moves beyond observation into the realm of creation. This is not a tool for analyzing *the* market; it is a crucible for forging and testing *a thousand possible markets*. Its purpose is to allow the sovereign to move from the role of a passive analyst to that of an active architect of economic systems.

## 2. Key Features & Functionality

*   **Generative Economic Modeling:** The engine does not rely on pre-built models. It uses an AI to construct an agent-based simulation of a national economy on the fly, based on a few high-level parameters defined by the architect.
*   **Parameter Control:** The architect has command over the fundamental laws of the simulated world: monetary policy (interest rates), fiscal policy (government spending), and even the psychological makeup of its citizens (agent risk aversion).
*   **Stochastic Events:** The architect can introduce "technological shocks," simulating the unpredictable leaps of innovation that drive real economic change.
*   **AI-Driven Narrative:** The output is not just a set of charts. The AI provides a qualitative, narrative summary of the simulated decade, explaining the "why" behind the numbers and describing the story of the economy it created.

## 3. AI Integration (Gemini API)

*   **Agent-Based Simulation (Conceptual):** The core of the module is a single, powerful `generateContent` call. The prompt instructs the AI to "act as a world-class macroeconomic simulator." The parameters provided by the user become the initial conditions for an agent-based model that the AI runs conceptually. The AI's vast training data includes the principles of economics, game theory, and complex systems, allowing it to generate a plausible and internally consistent simulation.
*   **Structured Narrative Output:** A `responseSchema` is critical. It commands the AI to return not just the final numbers, but a complete time-series of key economic indicators (GDP, inflation, unemployment) for each year of the simulation, *and* a narrative summary of the economic story.

## 4. Primary Data Models

*   **Local State:** The component manages the economic `params` locally.
*   **`SimulationResult`:** A structured object returned by the AI, containing `narrativeSummary` and a `timeSeries` array of economic data points.

## 5. Technical Architecture

*   **Frontend:**
    *   **Component:** `EconomicSynthesisEngineView.tsx`
    *   **State Management:** Local `useState` for parameters and results.
    *   **Key Libraries:** `recharts` to visualize the time-series data generated by the AI.
*   **Backend:**
    *   **Primary Service:** `generative-economics-api`
    *   **Key Endpoints:** `POST /api/economics/simulate`
    *   **Logic:** This is a pure AI-driven endpoint. The service's primary role is to construct the detailed prompt and `responseSchema` based on the user's parameters, call the Gemini API, validate the structured response, and return it to the client. It is the conduit to the crucible.
