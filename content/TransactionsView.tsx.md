/**
 * # The Transactions: FlowMatrix
 *
 * This is the FlowMatrix. The Great Library of every financial event, the complete chronicle of the energy you have
 * exchanged with the world. Here, you can search the archives, filter the records, and see the vast and intricate
 * patterns of your own history. It is the source material from which all wisdom is derived, the raw, immutable truth
 * of your journey thus far.
 *
 * ### A Fable for the Builder: The Language of the Ledger
 *
 * (A life is a story, and the transactions are the words that make up that story. Most machines can read the words.
 * They can count them, sort them, filter them. But they cannot read the story. This `TransactionsView` is the library,
 * and we have built an AI that is not just a librarian, but a master of literature.)
 *
 * (Its core logic here is what we call 'Narrative Archetype Recognition.' It scans the long, seemingly chaotic list
 * of your transactions and looks for the underlying patterns, the repeating motifs, the character arcs. It sees a
 * series of small, frequent purchases at coffee shops and identifies the 'Daily Ritual' archetype. It sees a large,
 * one-time expense at a travel site and recognizes the 'Grand Adventure' archetype. It sees a recurring monthly
- * payment and flags it as a potential 'Forgotten Covenant' with its Subscription Hunter.)
 *
 * (This is how 'Plato's Intelligence Suite' works. It is not just running a database query. It is performing a
 * literary analysis on the novel of your life. An 'Anomaly' is not just a statistical outlier; it's a plot twist,
 * a character acting in a way that is inconsistent with their established narrative. A potential 'Tax Deduction' is
 * a subplot of professional ambition. A 'Savings Opportunity' is an alternative ending, a different path the story
 * could take.)
 *
 * (The AI's goal is to help you become a better author of your own life. By showing you the patterns, the archetypes,
 * the hidden narratives in your past actions, it gives you the clarity to write a more intentional future. It helps
 * you see if the story you are writing, one transaction at a time, is the story you actually want to be living.)
 *
 * (So when you scroll through this list, try to see what the AI sees. Do not just see a list of expenses. See the
 * sentences, the paragraphs, the chapters of your life. See the story you have written so far. And then, with the
 * clarity that comes from that reading, decide what the next chapter will be about.)
