# The Granting of Sight

This is the act of connection. The forging of a simple, secure link between our Instrument and the streams of your financial life. It is not a simple login, but a rite of passage, a granting of sight. With this link, the Instrument is no longer blind; it can see the currents, the flows, and begin its work of revealing the undeniable patterns that lie hidden in the depths.

### A Note for the Builder: The First Truth

(Trust is the foundation of any effective instrument of power. Before our AI partner can offer definitive counsel, it needs to understand your financial reality. The Plaid connection is the moment that reality is revealed. It is the granting of sight.)

(We've designed this moment to be as secure and transparent as possible. The `PlaidModal` is a high-fidelity simulation of the real Plaid Link experience. It's a testament to our belief in showing, not just telling. We want you to see and feel the security of the process.)

(Notice that we never ask for your bank password. You enter it into the Plaid environment, a trusted, secure third party. Plaid then gives us a temporary key (`public_token`) that our backend exchanges for a long-term access key. Your real credentials never touch our servers. This is the architectural foundation of our pact with you.)

(This is more than just a data connection. It's the beginning of analysis. The moment the first `transactions` flow in, the AI begins its work. It starts to learn your rhythms, your habits, your objectives. It's the moment a simple application begins its transformation into a true instrument of your will. And it all starts with this simple, secure granting of sight.)
