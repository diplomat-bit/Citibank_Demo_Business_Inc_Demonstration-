# The Atlas of Grand Campaigns

This is the Atlas of Grand Campaigns, the registry of the Sovereign's most profound and life-altering objectives. These are not mere savings goals; they are quests, epic campaigns that will define their future. This data is the heart of the Declared Objectives view. One campaign is intentionally left without a plan, inviting the sovereign to collaborate with the AI, while the other includes a pre-built, detailed AI strategy to immediately showcase the depth of the AI's tactical guidance.
