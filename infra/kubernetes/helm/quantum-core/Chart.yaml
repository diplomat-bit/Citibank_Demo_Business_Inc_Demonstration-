# This section lists the sub-charts (dependencies) that this umbrella chart will deploy.
# Each microservice or core component of the Quantum platform should be its own chart.
# This allows for independent versioning and deployment of each component.
# The sub-charts can be located in the 'charts/' directory or a remote repository.
