The provided instruction is to "make this intio one prompot". This seems to be a typo and likely means "make this into one prompt". The goal is to consolidate a large, detailed specification of "idgafAI" into a single, usable prompt.

The file "features/a" is empty. The instruction applies to the *content* of the specification, not a specific file in the codebase that needs to be modified to incorporate it. Since the target file is empty, and the instruction is about creating a consolidated prompt, I cannot directly modify the empty file to fulfill the instruction. The instruction describes creating canonical prompt files and modifying other files to *point* to those canonical prompts.

Therefore, since the instruction does not apply to the specific file "features/a" in a way that can be executed by modifying its content, I will return the original, empty code for the file.
