# The Roster of Strategic Alliances

This is the registry of strategically aligned entities, the catalog of companies that operate with both profit and purpose. Each entry is a potential alliance, an opportunity for the sovereign to align their capital with their values. This data is the heart of the Strategic Impact Investing feature, a testament to the philosophy that finance is an instrument of will. It is a curated list, designed to be inspiring and worthy of the Sovereign's capital.
