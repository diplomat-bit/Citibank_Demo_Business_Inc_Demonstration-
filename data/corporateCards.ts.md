# The Armory

This is the armory, a comprehensive registry of the instruments of corporate expenditure. Each entry is a `CorporateCard` issued to an agent, complete with its own set of permissions, limits, and statuses. This is not a small list; it is a robust and extensive catalog designed to simulate a real, thriving enterprise. This rich dataset is the absolute bedrock of the Corporate Command Center, allowing for complex demonstrations of command, control, and oversight. It is the source of the sovereign's power over their domain.
