# The Armory of Corporate Cards

This is the armory, a comprehensive registry of the tools of corporate expenditure. Each entry is a `CorporateCard` issued to an agent of the enterprise, complete with its own set of permissions and limits. This rich dataset is the bedrock of the Corporate Command Center, allowing for complex demonstrations of card management, control, and oversight.
