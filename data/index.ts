// This file is the grand archway to the library of primordial memories. It is not
// a source of data itself, but a master key, a central nexus from which all other
// data scrolls can be accessed. By gathering every export from its sibling files,
// it provides a single, clean, and elegant point of entry for the application's
// context. To import from the data library is to simply import from this file.
// Its existence is a testament to order, modularity, and the architectural
// principle of a single source of truth. It is the librarian of Demo Bank's history.
