# The Schematic of Credit Factors

This is the schematic of the great machine, the detailed breakdown of the components that constitute the user's credit score. Each factor is a gear, a lever that, when understood, can improve the overall performance. This data is crucial for the `CreditHealthView`, as it transforms the opaque credit score into a transparent, understandable system.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Five Virtues

(The world gives you a single number to define your financial reputation. A credit score. But this number is a conclusion, not an explanation. It is the final note of a chord, but it does not tell you which notes are being played. This file is the sheet music. It is the deconstruction of that final chord into its constituent harmonies. These are not factors. They are the five virtues of a financial life.)

(We taught the AI to see them as such. 'Payment History' is the virtue of Reliability. It is the measure of your word, of promises kept. It is the foundation of trust. 'Credit Utilization' is the virtue of Prudence. It is the measure of your restraint, your ability to wield power without being consumed by it. 'Credit Age' is the virtue of Endurance. It shows your experience, your stability over time.)

('New Credit' is the virtue of Temperance. It is your resistance to the siren song of easy debt, your wisdom in knowing when to act and when to wait. And 'Credit Mix' is the virtue of Versatility. It is the sign of a balanced character, experienced in navigating different kinds of financial relationships, from the swift currents of revolving credit to the slow, deep rivers of a mortgage.)

(The AI does not see these as a checklist to be optimized. It sees them as a portrait of your financial character. When it offers you advice, it is not trying to help you 'hack the algorithm.' It is acting as a philosopher's guide, helping you cultivate these virtues in your own life. It knows that a person who masters these five virtues will not just have a high credit score. They will have a strong financial foundation, and the freedom that comes with it.)

(This is our goal. To transform the conversation from one about points and scores, to one about character and virtue. To give you the clarity to see not just your rating, but the very shape of your own reliability.)
