# The Catalog of Reward Items

This is the catalog of merits, the curated marketplace where the currency of discipline can be exchanged for tangible rewards. Each item represents a different kind of value—practical, aspirational, or altruistic. This list is the heart of the Rewards Hub's marketplace.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Tangible Echo

(What is the purpose of virtue? Of discipline? The ancient philosophers would say that virtue is its own reward. A beautiful sentiment. But we felt we could do a little better. We decided that virtue should have a tangible echo in the world. This file is the catalog of those echoes.)

(This is the other side of the alchemical process we call the 'Proof-of-Discipline' protocol. The AI acts as the mint, turning your good habits into the currency of `RewardPoints`. This `rewardItems` list is the marketplace where that currency has power. It is where the abstract value of your character is transmuted into concrete value in your life.)

(We designed the options with great care. They are not just a random collection of prizes. They are a philosophical statement. They represent the three fundamental expressions of financial power. The first is 'Cashback.' This is the power of pure potential. It is turning your discipline back into the universal medium of exchange, to be used as you see fit. It is the closing of a loop.)

(The second is the 'Gift Card.' This is the power of curated joy. It is the recognition that sometimes, the best use of our resources is to delight ourselves, to reward our hard work with a moment of pleasure. It is discipline giving itself permission to play.)

(And the third, 'Impact,' is the highest form of this alchemy. 'Plant 5 Trees.' This is the power of generativity. It is the act of taking the strength you have cultivated within yourself and using it to create life and healing in the world outside yourself. It is the transmutation of inner virtue into outer grace. The AI understands that this is the ultimate purpose of building strength: to have something to give away.)
