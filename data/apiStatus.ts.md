This is the report from the Engine Room, a real-time diagnostic of the vital connections that power the Instrument. Each entry is a status check on a critical third-party API, from Plaid to Google Gemini itself. This data is not for show; it is a foundational element of the application's narrative, proving its architecture is that of a serious, enterprise-grade platform. It builds trust through absolute transparency, showing the health of every gear in the great machine.
