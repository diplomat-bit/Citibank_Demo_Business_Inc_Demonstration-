// These are the dispatches from the application's consciousness, the whispers and
// alerts that Quantum sends to the Visionary. Each notification is a breadcrumb,
// a small, actionable piece of information designed to draw the user's attention
// to important events within their financial world. This initial list ensures that
// the notification bell is alive with relevant information from the very first
// moment, making the application feel responsive and vigilant.
