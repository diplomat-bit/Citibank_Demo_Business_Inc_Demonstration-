# The Live Feed

This is the live feed from the corporate front lines, a real-time ticker tape of every action taken on behalf of the enterprise. Each entry is a data point, a clue to spending patterns, a potential policy violation, or a routine business expense. This stream of data is what gives the Corporate Command Center its immediacy and power, allowing for real-time analysis, charting, and the detection of financial anomalies. It is the pulse of the enterprise.
