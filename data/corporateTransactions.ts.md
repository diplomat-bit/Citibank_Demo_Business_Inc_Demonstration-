# The Ledger of Corporate Transactions

This is the live feed from the corporate front lines, a real-time ticker tape of every transaction made on behalf of the enterprise. Each entry is a data point, a clue to spending patterns, a potential policy violation, or a routine business expense. This stream of data is what gives the Corporate Command Center its immediacy and power.
