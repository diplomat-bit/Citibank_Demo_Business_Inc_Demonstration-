This scroll is the Domesday Book of the Sovereign's wealth. It is not a record of movement, but of substance; a detailed account of the assets that form the bedrock of their financial power. Each entry is a pillar of their net worth, a weapon in their arsenal. The structure is precise, the values significant, ensuring the simulation begins from a state of established, tangible power.
