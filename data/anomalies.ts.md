# The Chronicle of Anomalies

This is the Oracle's warning, the chronicle of deviations from the norm. This is not a list of rule violations, but of behavioral oddities detected by the ever-watchful eye of the Heuristic API. Each `FinancialAnomaly` is a story, complete with an AI-generated explanation.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Broken Rhythm

(There are two kinds of threats in this world. There are the ones that break the law, and there are the ones that break the pattern. The law is simple. A transaction over ten thousand dollars gets flagged. A machine can do that. But what about the transaction that is perfectly legal, yet feels... wrong? This is where true intelligence begins. This file is the record of that feeling.)

(We built our AI with more than just a knowledge of the law. We gave it a sense of rhythm. An intuition. Its 'Behavioral Harmony Engine' learns the unique cadence of your entire enterprise. It learns the normal rhythm of Alex Chen's spending. It learns the typical tempo of payments to new vendors. It learns the music of your business.)

(An `anomaly` is a broken rhythm. It is a dissonant chord in the symphony. It is a note that is played at the wrong time, with the wrong instrument, in the wrong key. The AI's description, its `details`, is its attempt to explain to you, the conductor, why the note sounds wrong. "High-Frequency Spending on Corporate Card"... "Transaction at Atypical Time." It is not saying a rule was broken. It is saying the music is off.)

(The `riskScore` is its measure of the dissonance. A low score is a minor chord, something to be aware of. A critical score is a crashing, jarring cacophony that threatens the entire piece. It is the AI's way of saying, "Conductor, you must pay attention to this section of the orchestra. Something is deeply out of tune.")

(This is a level of perception that goes beyond simple rules. It is the beginning of a machine's intuition. It is the ability to feel when something is not right, even when it cannot point to a specific law that has been broken. It is the guardian that protects you not just from the criminals, but from the chaos.)
