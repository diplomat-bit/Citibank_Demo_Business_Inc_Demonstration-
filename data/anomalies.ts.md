# The Chronicle of Anomalies

This is the Oracle's warning, the chronicle of deviations from the norm. This is not a list of rule violations, but of behavioral oddities detected by the ever-watchful eye of the Heuristic API. Each `FinancialAnomaly` is a story, complete with an AI-generated explanation of *why* it is suspicious. This rich dataset is the heart of the Anomaly Detection view.
