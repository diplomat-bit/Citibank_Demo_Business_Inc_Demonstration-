# The Data Index

This is the grand archway to the library of primordial memories. It is not a source of data itself, but a master key, a central nexus from which all other data scrolls can be accessed. By gathering every export, it provides a single, elegant point of entry for the application's context. It is the librarian of the Instrument's history.
