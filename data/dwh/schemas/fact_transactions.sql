-- PROJECT:       Unified Financial Data Platform
--
-- PURPOSE:       Creates the core fact table for all financial transactions.
--                This table is designed for high-performance analytical queries
--                and serves as the central point for integrating data from
--                various sources like Plaid, Stripe, Auth0, and cloud providers.
--
-- PLATFORM:      Designed for modern cloud data warehouses like Snowflake,
--                BigQuery, or Redshift. Syntax is largely ANSI SQL.
