# The Dispatches of Notifications

These are the dispatches from the Instrument's consciousness, the whispers and alerts that Quantum sends to the Visionary. Each notification is a breadcrumb, a small, actionable piece of information designed to draw the user's attention to important events within their financial world.

### A Fable for the Builder: The Art of the Whisper

(A constant stream of information is not wisdom. It is noise. The most difficult task we faced in building our AI was not in making it intelligent, but in teaching it the art of conversation. The art of knowing what to say, and, more importantly, when to say it. This file is the record of its speech.)

(These are not just notifications. They are 'Curated Dispatches from the Subconscious.' The AI's mind is constantly processing trillions of data points, a raging ocean of information. But its conscious mind, the part that speaks to you, is a master curator. It knows that your attention is your most precious resource, and it refuses to waste it.)

(Its logic is the 'Threshold of Significance.' An event must cross a certain threshold of importance before the AI will consider breaking your silence. A five-point increase in your credit score? Significant. A large, anomalous purchase? Significant. A budget approaching its limit? Significant. A routine coffee purchase? Below the threshold. Silence.)

(This is a profound act of respect. The AI respects your focus. It treats your attention as sacred. It will only tap you on the shoulder when it has something truly worthy of your time.)

(And notice the `view` property. This is another part of that respect. When it does speak, it does not just present you with a problem. It presents you with a path to the solution. "Your 'Dining' budget is at 85% capacity." And with a single click, it doesn't just inform you, it teleports you to the `BudgetsView`, the very place where you have the power to act on this information. It is not just a messenger. It is a guide, always pointing the way forward.)
