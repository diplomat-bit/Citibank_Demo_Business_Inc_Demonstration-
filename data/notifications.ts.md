# The Dispatches

These are the dispatches from the application's core intelligence, the whispers and alerts that Quantum sends to the Sovereign. Each notification is a breadcrumb, a small, actionable piece of intelligence designed to draw the user's attention to important events within their domain. This initial list ensures that the notification channel is alive with relevant intelligence from the very first moment, making the application feel responsive and vigilant.
