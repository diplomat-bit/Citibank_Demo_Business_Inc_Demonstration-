# The Central Clearing House

This is the central clearing house for corporate capital, the queue of commands awaiting execution. Each `PaymentOrder` is a formal decree to move resources, complete with a counterparty, amount, and status. This data is the lifeblood of the corporate finance suite, providing a realistic list of items that require attention, approval, or tracking. The variety of statuses demonstrates the full lifecycle of a payment, from decree to completion or failure.
