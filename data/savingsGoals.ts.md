# The Codex of Minor Campaigns

This is the codex of minor aspirations, the short-term objectives that give texture and motivation to the sovereign's financial journey. These are not the grand, life-altering campaigns, but the smaller, satisfying milestones along the way. This data populates the Savings Goals instrument, turning abstract wants into tangible, trackable objectives that make the act of saving a tactical exercise.
