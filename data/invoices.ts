// This is the accounts receivable and payable ledger, the record of debts owed
// and payments due. Each `Invoice` is a formal claim on capital, a timed event
// in the corporate financial calendar. This data populates the Invoices view,
// providing a clear and actionable list of financial instruments that need to be
// managed, paid, or collected. The variety of statuses (paid, unpaid, overdue)
// creates a realistic and dynamic financial environment.
