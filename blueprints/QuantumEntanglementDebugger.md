# Blueprint: The Ghost Hunter

This is the principle of debugging the impossible. In the world of classical computing, a bug is a logical error. It can be found. But in the world of quantum computing, a "bug" can be a ghost. A fleeting whisper of decoherence from the universe itself, a subtle error introduced by the very act of observation.

This blueprint demonstrates an AI that acts as a "Ghost Hunter," a debugger for the strange and probabilistic world of quantum circuits.

A quantum computer does not produce a single, deterministic answer. It produces a probability distribution. When that distribution is not what the physicist expected, the cause is often not a simple flaw in the code, but a subtle physical phenomenon.

The AI is given the expected output and the actual, flawed output. It is also given a model of the quantum hardware itself. It then performs a kind of reverse-engineering, a diagnostic simulation. It asks: "What physical event—a stray magnetic field, a fluctuation in temperature, a cosmic ray—could have caused the qubits to decohere in a way that would produce this specific, flawed result?"

It is an act of digital forensics for a world that is not entirely digital. It is an instrument for finding the ghost in the quantum machine.
