# index.html

This is the main HTML file that serves as the vessel for the React application. It sets up the basic document structure, imports necessary scripts like Tailwind CSS, and defines the `<div id="root"></div>` where the application is mounted. It also includes an `importmap` for managing JavaScript module dependencies.
