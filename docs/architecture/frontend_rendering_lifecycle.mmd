    BB --> V %% Aurora Illusion continues, potentially influenced by FramerMotion later

    note right of A
        The browser begins parsing the index.html document.
        This initial phase focuses on rapid document loading,
        critical for perceived performance.
    end
    note right of B
        Metadata for SEO and browser behavior (description, keywords, robots),
        Open Graph/Twitter cards, and various favicon links are processed.
    end
    note right of C
        <link rel="preload"> tags instruct the browser to fetch
        crucial assets (images, custom fonts, hero video, primary CSS)
        early in the loading process, improving Core Web Vitals (LCP, FCP).
    end
    note right of D
        The main external stylesheet (/style.css) is loaded,
        applying global visual rules.
    end
    note right of E
        Inline <style> block defines CSS variables for a consistent
        design system, the subtle 'aurora illusion' background animation,
        and initial styles for the preloader. These styles are immediately
        available for rendering.
    end
    note right of F
        Essential third-party JavaScript libraries are loaded via CDN:
        TailwindCSS for utility-first styling, Plaid Link for secure
        bank account connectivity, and D3.js for advanced data visualization.
    end
    note right of G
        The WebFont Loader script ensures custom brand fonts (Inter)
        are loaded optimally, managing potential FOUC (Flash Of Unstyled Content)
        and ensuring typography consistency.
    end
    note right of H
        The #initial-loader div becomes visible, displaying a branded
        spinner, logo, and "Initializing AI Engines..." text,
        providing a smooth, branded user waiting experience.
    end
    note right of I
        The <script type="importmap"> is parsed, dynamically mapping
        module specifiers to their corresponding CDN URLs (e.g., React, GenAI).
        This enables modern ES module syntax in the browser.
    end
    note right of J
        Core frontend framework modules like 'react' and 'react-dom/client'
        are fetched and evaluated based on the importmap.
    end
    note right of K
        Advanced AI/ML and data fetching libraries, such as @google/genai
        and @apollo/client (for GraphQL), are loaded.
    end
    note right of L
        UI/UX enhancement libraries, including Framer Motion for animations,
        Zustand for state management, and charting libraries Recharts and
        Chart.js, are loaded.
    end
    note right of M
        Essential utility libraries like Day.js for date manipulation
        are loaded.
    end
    note right of N
        The main application script, /index.tsx, is executed,
        initiating the React application.
    end
    note right of O
        The React application mounts and hydrates the content
        within the <div id="root"> element, taking control of
        the DOM.
    end
    note right of P
        React renders the initial hierarchy of application components,
        including dashboards, navigation, and core UI elements.
    end
    note right of Q
        Global application state is initialized and managed using Zustand,
        ensuring consistent data across components.
    end
    note right of R
        Apollo Client performs GraphQL queries to fetch crucial
        financial data, user portfolios, and AI-generated insights
        from the backend.
    end
    note right of S
        The Plaid Link client is initialized, securely connecting
        user bank accounts to aggregate financial data within the platform.
    end
    note right of T
        Fetched financial data is fed into the AI core for advanced
        predictive analytics, risk assessment, and personalized recommendations.
    end
    note right of U
        Interactive and high-fidelity data visualizations are rendered
        using D3.js, Recharts, and Chart.js, presenting complex financial
        information clearly.
    end
    note right of V
        Framer Motion is utilized to apply sophisticated, performant
        animations and transitions to UI elements, enhancing user
        engagement and visual feedback.
    end
    note right of W
        The preloader's text might dynamically update, for example,
        to "AI Engines Activated" or "Data Loaded", providing
        real-time feedback before fade-out.
    end
    note right of X
        After a configurable delay (750ms in seed) and upon React
        application readiness, the #initial-loader gracefully
        fades out and is removed from the DOM, revealing the full application.
    end
    note right of Y
        The application is now fully loaded, interactive, and responsive
        to user input, providing a complete financial intelligence experience.
    end
    note right of Z
        Google Analytics (GA4), Hotjar (heatmaps, session recordings),
        and Intercom (customer support) are fully initialized to
        track user behavior and provide support.
    end
    note right of AA
        Cookiebot, or a similar CMP, activates to manage and enforce
        user consent preferences for data tracking, ensuring GDPR/CCPA
        compliance.
    end
    note right of BB
        The CSS-driven 'aurora illusion' background effect
        runs continuously and subtly throughout the application's lifespan,
        contributing to the premium aesthetic.
    end
    note right of CC
        JSON-LD structured data for Organization, WebSite, and
        FinancialService schema is present in the HTML, allowing
        search engines to better understand and represent the content.
    end
    note right of DD
        A specific message and placeholder content are displayed
        if JavaScript is disabled, informing the user of the
        platform's requirements and offering an alternative view.
    end
