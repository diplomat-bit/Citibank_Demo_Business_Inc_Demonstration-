## The First Power Integration: The Autonomous AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

### Vision
This document outlines the architecture for one of the platform's two most powerful integration concepts: **The Autonomous AI SRE**. This system transcends simple monitoring by creating a closed-loop incident response system. It will integrate the **DevOps**, **AI Platform**, and **Machine Learning** modules with best-in-class observability, incident management, and code repository platforms.

The goal is to create an AI that can:
1.  **Observe:** Ingest monitoring data to detect not just failures, but *precursors* to failure.
2.  **Orient:** Correlate disparate signals (logs, metrics, recent deployments) to understand the context of a problem.
3.  **Decide:** Formulate a hypothesis about the root cause and determine a probable solution.
4.  **Act:** Automatically generate and propose a code fix as a pull request for human approval.

This transforms the human operator from a frantic firefighter into a calm, strategic commander who reviews and approves the AI's proposed solutions.

### Key Modules & External API Integrations

| Internal Module        | External Platform | API Integration Purpose                                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DevOps**             | **Datadog API**   | Ingest metrics, logs, and APM traces for observability.    |
| **DevOps**             | **PagerDuty API** | Manage the incident lifecycle: create, acknowledge, update.  |
| **DevOps**             | **GitHub API**    | Analyze recent code changes and create automated pull requests. |
| **AI Platform**        | **Gemini API**    | The core reasoning engine for diagnosis and code generation.  |
| **Machine Learning**   | (Internal)        | Anomaly detection models trained on historical metric data.  |

### Architectural Flow: An Incident Lifecycle

#### Step 1: Detection (Datadog -> DevOps Module)
An alert fires in Datadog (e.g., "p99 latency for `/v1/payments` > 2000ms"). A webhook from Datadog sends a detailed payload to a secure endpoint in our platform.

- **Code Example (Conceptual - Node.js/Express Endpoint):**
  ```typescript
  // api/webhooks/datadog.ts
  import express from 'express';
  // This would trigger the incident response flow
  import { incidentResponseAI } from '../services/ai_sre';

  const router = express.Router();

  router.post('/datadog-webhook', (req, res) => {
    const { title, body, alert_type } = req.body;
    console.log(`Received Datadog alert: ${title}`);

    // Asynchronously trigger the AI SRE workflow
    if (alert_type === 'error') {
      incidentResponseAI.start(req.body);
    }

    res.status(200).send('OK');
  });

  export default router;
  ```

#### Step 2: Triage & Orientation (DevOps + AI Platform -> PagerDuty + GitHub)
The `incidentResponseAI` service is triggered.

1.  **Create Incident:** The service first calls the PagerDuty API to create a new incident, notifying the on-call human engineer.
2.  **Gather Context:** It then makes parallel API calls to:
    - **Datadog:** To pull detailed logs and metrics for the affected service from the 15 minutes leading up to the alert.
    - **GitHub:** To fetch the last 5 commits deployed to the `main` branch that affected the `payments-api` service.

- **Code Example (Conceptual - Python AI SRE Service):**
  ```python
  # services/ai_sre.py
  from pagerduty_client import PagerDutyClient
  from datadog_client import DatadogClient
  from github_client import GitHubClient
  from gemini_client import GeminiClient

  class AIsre:
      def start(self, alert_payload):
          # 1. Create Incident in PagerDuty
          incident = PagerDutyClient.create_incident(alert_payload['title'])
          
          # 2. Gather Context
          logs = DatadogClient.get_logs("service:payments-api", "error")
          metrics = DatadogClient.get_metrics("p99_latency:payments-api")
          recent_commits = GitHubClient.get_commits("main", "services/payments-api")
          
          # 3. Orient and Decide (see Step 3)
          self.diagnose(incident, logs, metrics, recent_commits)

  incidentResponseAI = AIsre()
  ```

#### Step 3: Diagnosis & Decision (AI Platform -> Gemini)
The AI SRE service now has all the context: the alert, the logs, the metrics, and recent code changes. It formats this information into a single, massive prompt for the Gemini API.

- **Prompt Example (to Gemini):**
  ```
  You are an expert Site Reliability Engineer. An incident has occurred.
  
  ALERT: p99 latency for /v1/payments > 2000ms.
  
  METRICS: [Chart data showing latency spike starting at 10:32 AM]
  
  LOGS (showing repeated errors):
  [10:32:01] ERROR: Upstream provider timeout for 'Stripe'. Status: 503
  [10:32:05] ERROR: Upstream provider timeout for 'Stripe'. Status: 503
  ...
  
  RECENT COMMITS:
  - Commit #abc123 (10:15 AM): "feat: Add new metadata field to Stripe request" by alex.c
    - File changed: services/payments-api/stripe_client.ts
    - Diff: + "metadata: { 'new_feature_flag': true }"
  
  Based on ALL the information above, provide a root cause analysis and suggest a specific code fix.
  Respond in JSON format: {"root_cause": "...", "suggested_fix": "..."}
  ```

#### Step 4: Action (AI Platform -> GitHub)
The AI SRE service receives the JSON response from Gemini.

1.  **Update Incident:** It posts the `root_cause` analysis as a note on the PagerDuty incident.
2.  **Generate Fix:** It takes the `suggested_fix` and uses the GitHub API to:
    a. Create a new branch (e.g., `fix/incident-123-stripe-timeout`).
    b. Apply the code change suggested by Gemini.
    c. Commit the change with a descriptive message.
    d. Create a new Pull Request, referencing the PagerDuty incident, and assign it to the on-call engineer for review.

- **Code Example (Conceptual - Python, continuation of AIsre class):**
  ```python
      def diagnose(self, incident, logs, metrics, commits):
          prompt = self.format_prompt(logs, metrics, commits)
          diagnosis = GeminiClient.generate(prompt) # The JSON response from Gemini
          
          # 1. Update PagerDuty
          PagerDutyClient.add_note(incident['id'], f"AI Analysis: {diagnosis['root_cause']}")
          
          # 2. Create PR in GitHub
          fix_details = {
              "branch": f"fix/incident-{incident['id']}",
              "commit_message": f"Fix: Revert metadata field causing Stripe timeouts\n\nResolves INC-{incident['id']}",
              "file_path": "services/payments-api/stripe_client.ts",
              "code_change": diagnosis['suggested_fix']
          }
          pull_request = GitHubClient.create_pull_request(fix_details)
          
          PagerDutyClient.add_note(incident['id'], f"Automated fix proposed: {pull_request['url']}")
          print("Autonomous incident response complete. Awaiting human approval.")
  ```

### UI/UX Integration
- The **DevOps** module will feature an "Incidents" view.
- This view will show a list of PagerDuty incidents.
- Clicking an incident will open a detailed timeline view showing:
    - The initial Datadog alert.
    - The AI's root cause analysis from Gemini.
    - A direct link to the automatically generated GitHub pull request.
- The on-call engineer can then review the code, approve the PR, and resolve the incident, having only had to perform a high-level strategic review instead of manual debugging.
